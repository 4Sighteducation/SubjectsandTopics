# Session Summary - September 30, 2025

## üéâ Major Accomplishments Today

### 1. Complete Production Readiness Analysis ‚úÖ
- **Created:** `PRODUCTION-READINESS-ANALYSIS.md` in FLASH repo
- **Finding:** App is 95% complete (not 85%!)
- **Key Discovery:** Study mode IS fully implemented (925 lines!)
- **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks to beta testing (not 3-4 weeks)

### 2. Curriculum Pipeline Strategy ‚úÖ
- **Created:** Two comprehensive strategy documents
- **V1:** Complete greenfield approach
- **V2:** Refactor plan based on existing Topic List Scraper
- **Scope:** UK boards + International expansion (Cambridge, IB, Edexcel Intl)

### 3. Repository Setup ‚úÖ
- **Repurposed:** github.com/4Sighteducation/SubjectsandTopics
- **Archived:** Old Node.js version in `archive/nodejs-version` branch
- **Created:** Complete Python pipeline structure
- **Location:** `C:\Users\tonyd\OneDrive - 4Sight Education Ltd\Apps\flash-curriculum-pipeline`

### 4. Specification Constraint System Design ‚úÖ
- **Key Insight:** Subjects like History need selection rules captured
- **Example:** History A-Level requires 1 British + 1 non-British, prohibited combos, 200-year span
- **Solution:** Enhanced extraction capturing metadata, components, constraints, vocabulary

### 5. Database Migration ‚úÖ
- **Added:** 5 new tables in Supabase
  - `specification_metadata`
  - `spec_components`
  - `selection_constraints`
  - `subject_vocabulary`
  - `assessment_guidance`
- **Enhanced:** `curriculum_topics` with new columns
- **Verified:** 22,770 existing topics still intact ‚úÖ

### 6. Automated Pipeline Built ‚úÖ
- **Created:** `pipeline.py` - single command orchestrator
- **Created:** `aqa_scraper_enhanced.py` - complete automation
- **Flow:** Find URL ‚Üí Download PDF ‚Üí Extract with AI ‚Üí Upload to Supabase
- **No manual steps** - fully automated end-to-end!

### 7. FIRST SUCCESSFUL TEST! üéâ
```
‚úÖ Downloaded AQA History A-Level specification (2.72 MB)
‚úÖ Extracted 212,488 characters from PDF
‚úÖ AI extracted metadata, components, constraints, options, vocabulary
‚úÖ Uploaded to Supabase:
   - Metadata: SUCCESS (ID: 6980f08d-71f8-48c6-a0ce-510d12794a7d)
   - Components: 3 uploaded
   - Constraints: 4 uploaded
   - Topics: Need schema fix
   - Vocabulary: Need data format fix
```

## What We Learned

### Technical Discoveries
1. ‚úÖ AQA moved PDFs to CDN (sanity.io)
2. ‚úÖ PDFs are encrypted - need PyCryptodome
3. ‚úÖ Claude 3.5 Sonnet extracts structured data beautifully
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows console doesn't like Unicode emojis
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è curriculum_topics uses exam_board_subject_id foreign key

### AI Extraction Quality
**Components Extracted:**
- Component 1: Breadth Study (choose 1 from 11)
- Component 2: Depth Study (choose 1 from 20)  
- Component 3: Historical Investigation (custom)

**Constraints Extracted:**
- Geographic diversity (British + non-British)
- Prohibited combinations
- Chronological span (200+ years)
- Component requirements

**This is EXACTLY what we needed!** ‚úÖ

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Tomorrow)

1. **Fix Topic Upload Schema** 
   - Adapt uploader to work with `exam_board_subject_id` foreign key
   - Either find existing records or create them
   - Test topic upload works

2. **Fix Vocabulary Upload**
   - Debug data format issue
   - Ensure vocabulary uploads correctly

3. **Test Complete Flow**
   - Run pipeline again
   - Verify all data in Supabase
   - Check data quality in database

### This Week

4. **Add More AQA Subjects**
   - Find PDF URLs for Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics
   - Test with simpler subjects (Math - no complex constraints)
   - Compare extraction quality

5. **Enhance AI Prompts**
   - Based on results, refine prompts
   - Improve accuracy for different subject types
   - Handle edge cases

6. **Add OCR Scraper**
   - Adapt AQA scraper for OCR
   - Test with OCR History to compare
   - Document differences between boards

### Next 2 Weeks

7. **Complete UK Boards**
   - Edexcel, WJEC, SQA, CCEA
   - Unified pipeline for all 6 boards
   - Quality validation

8. **Automation**
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Scheduled runs
   - Monitoring dashboard

## Key Decisions Made

1. ‚úÖ **Separate Repo:** flash-curriculum-pipeline (formerly SubjectsandTopics)
2. ‚úÖ **Python over JavaScript:** Better scraping/PDF libraries
3. ‚úÖ **Anthropic Claude:** Primary AI for extraction
4. ‚úÖ **Direct Supabase:** No intermediate database
5. ‚úÖ **Enhanced Extraction:** Capture constraints, not just topics
6. ‚úÖ **Automated End-to-End:** No manual PDF downloads

---
