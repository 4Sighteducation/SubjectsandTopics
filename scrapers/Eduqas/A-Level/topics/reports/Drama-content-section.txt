1. Two creative process logs (AO1)
These must be monitored at least once each by the teacher for authentication
purposes. The learner and teacher must sign the authentication statement
included on the cover sheet.
2. Two performances or designs (AO1 and AO2)
o the final performances or designs must be realised and recorded audio-
visually
o learners, including design candidates, must be clearly identified by name
and candidate number at the start of each group performance
o the recording of each piece must be unedited and of the complete
performance from start to finish, filmed from the audience perspective
o all performances must be submitted via e-portfolio.
3. An evaluation of extract 2, the reinterpreted text performance (AO4). This must
be monitored at least once by the teacher for authentication purposes. The
learner and teacher must sign the authentication statement included on the cover
sheet.
Moderation and submission of marks
• The internal completion date is determined by the centre and the centre must
take into account time needed for internal assessment, internal moderation and
submission of marks to WJEC.
• Individual cover sheets, available on the WJEC website, will be used for
recording marks to be sent to the moderator. Centres must retain copies of all
mark sheets sent to the moderator.
• It is essential that where there is more than one teacher in a centre, work from all
teaching groups is standardised internally. This is designed to ensure that the
final assessment reflects a single agreed standard for all teaching groups
involved.

AS DRAMA and THEATRE 21
• Centres are required to submit marks for internally assessed work online by a
specified date in May.
• When the marks have been submitted to WJEC, the online system will apply the
sample formula based on the overall rank order for the total entry and
immediately identify the sample of learners whose work is selected for
moderation.
• All work for learners in the sample must be uploaded via the WJEC e-portfolio
system or sent to the moderator by the required date in May.
• All necessary documentation can be found on the website.
• As a result of the moderation, the marks of learners may be adjusted to bring the
centre's marks into line with the national standard. If required, the moderator will
ask for additional samples of work and if necessary, the work of all learners will
be called for and externally moderated regardless of entry numbers. In this case,
all of the work will be sent to the moderator.
• All centres will receive detailed feedback from the moderation in August.
• All work not submitted to WJEC should be retained by the centre until October of
the year of certification.

4 TECHNICAL INFORMATION
4.1 Making entries
This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the
course. Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series each year,
until the end of the life of this specification. Summer 2017 will be the first
assessment opportunity.
A qualification may be taken more than once. Candidates must resit all examination
components in the same series.
Marks for NEA may be carried forward for the life of the specification. If a candidate
resits an NEA component (rather than carrying forward the previous NEA mark), it is
the new mark that will count towards the overall grade, even if it is lower than a
previous attempt.
Where a candidate has certificated on two or more previous occasions, the most
recent NEA mark is carried forward, regardless of whether that mark is higher or
lower (unless that mark is absent)
The entry code appears below.
WJEC Eduqas AS Drama: B690QS
The current edition of our Entry Procedures and Coding Information gives up-to-date
entry procedures.
4.2 Grading, awarding and reporting
AS qualifications are reported as a grade on the scale from A to E. Results not
attaining the minimum standard for the award will be reported as U (unclassified).
AS qualifications are free-standing and are awarded in their own right. Assessments
at AS cannot contribute to an A level grade.

APPENDIX A
List of texts for Component 1
Learners must choose one text from the list for their reinterpreted performance. They may, if
they wish, choose a second text from the list for their text performance. Throughout the
whole qualification, learners must study texts from a range of social, historical and cultural
contexts.

APPENDIX B
List of suitable theatre practitioners and theatre companies
Learners must choose either a theatre practitioner or a theatre company to use as a basis
for creating and developing the re-interpreted text performance in Component 1. They may
either choose one from the list below or choose any other suitable practitioner or company.
Centres must ensure that the practitioner or company chosen is suitable for both the text and
the abilities of the learners in the group. If in doubt about the suitability of the chosen
practitioner or company, please contact WJEC for advice.

• Each piece is marked separately out of 50
• The appropriate band for each column should be established by determining which performance descriptor best reflects the candidate's performance
• The appropriate mark should then be established by determining the extent to which the candidate has met the criteria within the relevant band
• The total marks for both columns may reflect performance at different bands across the assessment objective, for example, a candidate may achieve band 4 for
AO1.a and band 5 for AO1.b
• It should be noted that the bands have been designed to assist the marking process by identifying individual levels of achievement and they do not correlate with
grade boundaries
• The creative log and the performance should be considered together to award one mark for AO1.1a. and one mark for AO1.1b.

APPENDIX D
Guidance for assessing Component 1
AO1 is assessed by considering both the performances or designs and the creative logs
together. In both, teachers must assess how the pieces have taken shape and not the skills
used to realise the pieces in performance, as they are assessed in Component 2.
There are two elements to this assessment objective.
AO1.1a: Create and develop ideas to communicate meaning as part of the theatre
making process
Column 1 of the assessment grid assesses AO1.1a. The creative logs and the final
performances or designs must demonstrate evidence of the process of creating and
developing theatre to communicate meaning. The following should be considered, as
appropriate to the skill, when assessing AO1.1a:
• how well ideas have been developed
• the choice and use of dramatic conventions, forms and techniques
• planning of the performance space
• use of proxemics
• rehearsal and refinement
• choice of design features e.g. lighting, sound, set, costume and make-up
• planning of design, including cues, to complement the action
• the learner's individual contribution to the making of the piece.
Learners choosing design may also include the following evidence as appropriate to the skill
(this is not an exhaustive list).
Lighting design
• cue sheets
• lighting plot
• mood board
Sound design
• cue sheets
• sound clips
• mood board
Set design (including props)
• set model
• ground plan
• measurements
• 3D set plan
• mood board
Costume design (including hair and make-up)
• fabric swatches
• mood board
© WJEC CBAC Ltd.
AS DRAMA and THEATRE 39
AO1.1b: Make connections between dramatic theory and practice
Column 2 of the assessment grid assesses AO1.1b. Both the creative logs and the practical
work must demonstrate clear links between dramatic theory and practice. The assessment
focuses on how learners apply research into both their chosen practitioner and text. The
application of relevant research should be evident in both the logs and the performances or
designs.
The following should be considered when assessing AO1.1b for the text extract:
• how the text is interpreted to convey meaning through:
o structure including the structure of the script
o characterisation
o mood and atmosphere.
The following should be considered when assessing AO1.1b for the reinterpreted extract:
• how research on the practitioner or company has been used to make the piece of
theatre
