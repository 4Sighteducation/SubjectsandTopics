PRACTICAL ENDORSEMENT
The assessment of practical skills is a compulsory requirement of the course of study
for A level qualifications in Chemistry. It will appear on all learners’ certificates as a
separately reported result, alongside the overall grade for the qualification. The
arrangements for the assessment of practical skills will be common to all awarding
organisations. These arrangements will include:
 A minimum of 12 practical activities to be carried out by each learner which,
together, meet the requirements of Appendix A part (b) (Practical skills
identified for direct assessment and developed through teaching and learning)
and Appendix A part (c) (Use of apparatus and techniques) from the
prescribed subject content, published by the Department for Education.
 Teachers will assess learners against Common Practical Assessment Criteria
(CPAC) issued by the awarding organisations. The CPAC (see pages 47 and
48) are based on the requirements of Appendix A parts (b) and (c) of the
subject content requirements published by the Department for Education, and
define the minimum standard required for the achievement of a pass.
 Each learner will keep an appropriate record of their assessed practical
activities.
 Learners who demonstrate the required standard across all the requirements
of the CPAC will receive a ‘pass’ grade.
 The practical activities prescribed in this specification (the specified
practicals) provide opportunities for demonstrating competence in all the skills
identified, together with the use of apparatus and techniques for each subject.
However, learners can also demonstrate these competences in any additional
practical activity undertaken throughout the course of study which covers the
requirements of Appendix A part (c).
 There will be no separate assessment of practical skills for AS qualifications.
 Learners will answer questions in the AS and A level examination papers that
assess the requirements of Appendix A part (a) (Practical skills identified for
indirect assessment and developed through teaching and learning) from the
prescribed subject content, published by the Department for Education.

Criteria for the assessment of practical competency in A level Chemistry (CPAC)
Competency Practical Mastery:
In order to achieve a pass, learners will need to have met the
following expectations.
Learners will be expected to develop these competencies
through the acquisition of the technical skills specified in
Appendix A part (c). Learners can demonstrate these
competencies in any practical activity undertaken throughout
the course of study. The practical activities prescribed in the
subject specification, which cover the requirements of
Appendix A part (c), will provide opportunities for
demonstrating competence in all the skills identified together
with the use of apparatus and practical techniques for each
subject.
Learners may work in groups but must be able to demonstrate
and record independent evidence of their competency. This
must include evidence of independent application of
investigative approaches and methods to practical work.
Teachers who award a pass to their learners need to be
confident that the learner consistently and routinely exhibits the
competencies listed below before completion of the A level
course.

Marking and Standardisation
The practical work is assessed by teachers. WJEC Eduqas will support teachers in making
judgements against the criteria for assessment.
In co-ordination with other exam boards, WJEC Eduqas will monitor how centres provide
learners with opportunities to develop and demonstrate the required practical skills and how
they mark the assessments.
Every centre will be monitored at least once in a two-year period in respect of at least one of
the A level science subjects.
In common with other exam boards, WJEC Eduqas will require centres to provide a
statement annually confirming they have taken reasonable steps to ensure that learners:
 have undertaken the minimum number of practical activities, and
 have made a contemporaneous record of their work.
If a centre fails to provide a statement, or provides a false statement, this will be treated as
malpractice and/or maladministration. Learners will only get a certificate for the practical
endorsement if they achieve at least a grade E in the examined part of the qualification.
Practical endorsement results for each learner need to be submitted by centres to WJEC
Eduqas by 15 May each year.

This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the
course. Assessment opportunities will be available in the months of May and June
from 2017 until the end of the life of this specification.
A qualification may be taken more than once. Candidates must resit all examination
components in the same series.
The endorsement grade for NEA may be carried forward for the life of the
specification, even if it was awarded by a different awarding body. If a candidate
resits an NEA component (rather than carrying forward the previous NEA
endorsement grade), it is the new grade that will be used, even if this is 'Not

Where a candidate has certificated on two or more previous occasions, the most
recent NEA endorsement grade is carried forward, even if this is 'Not Classified'.
