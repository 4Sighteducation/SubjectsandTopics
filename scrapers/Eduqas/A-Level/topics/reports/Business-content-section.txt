A LEVEL BUSINESS 3
The WJEC Eduqas A level in Business encourages learners to:
 develop an enthusiasm for studying business
 gain an holistic understanding of business in a range of contexts
 develop a critical understanding of organisations and their ability to meet society’s
needs and wants
 understand that business behaviour can be studied from a range of perspectives
 generate enterprising and creative approaches to business opportunities, problems
and issues
 be aware of the ethical dilemmas and responsibilities faced by organisations and
individuals
 acquire a range of relevant business and generic skills, including decision-making,
problem-solving, the challenging of assumptions and critical analysis
 apply numerical skills in a range of business contexts.
This A level specification introduces learners to the dynamic business environment and the
importance of entrepreneurial activity in creating business opportunities and sustaining
business growth. Learners will have the opportunity to develop a wide range of essential
skills required for higher education and employment.
The focus of the specification is to nurture an enthusiasm for studying business using
contemporary contexts, allowing learners to develop an appreciation of the strategic,
complex and inter-related nature of business issues from a local to global perspective.
A LEVEL BUSINESS 4
There are no prior learning requirements. Any requirements set for entry to a course
following this specification are at the discretion of centres. It is reasonable to assume
that many learners will have achieved qualifications equivalent to Level 2 at KS4.
Skills in Numeracy/Mathematics, Literacy/English and Information Communication
Technology will provide a good basis for progression to this Level 3 qualification.
Some learners will have already gained knowledge, understanding, and skills through
their study of business at GCSE or AS.
Quantitative skills are specified in the subject criteria and repeated in Appendix A of
this specification.
This specification provides a suitable foundation for the study of business or a related
area through a range of higher education courses, progression to the next level of
vocational qualifications or employment. In addition, the specification provides a
coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress
to further study in this subject.
This specification is not age specific and, as such, provides opportunities for learners
to extend their life-long learning.
This specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to achieve
because they have a particular protected characteristic.
The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.
The specification has been discussed with groups who represent the interests of a
diverse range of learners, and the specification will be kept under review.
Reasonable adjustments are made for certain learners in order to enable them to
access the assessments (e.g. candidates are allowed access to a Sign Language
Interpreter, using British Sign Language). Information on reasonable adjustments is
found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ):
Access Arrangements and Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational
Qualifications.
This document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk). As a consequence
of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will have a complete barrier
to any part of the assessment.

A LEVEL BUSINESS 5
The subject content enables learners to investigate different types and sizes of
organisations in various business sectors and environments, drawing on local,
national and global contexts. Learners will develop an holistic understanding of
business and enterprise and be aware of the opportunities and threats of operating
in a global marketplace.
Learners will be expected to be familiar with current issues in business and be able to
investigate, analyse and evaluate contemporary business opportunities and problems
in a wide range of contexts, whilst recognising how businesses adapt to operate in a
dynamic business environment.
Learners will gain an understanding of the important role played by small businesses
in the economy and the opportunities that exist for entrepreneurs, as well as the
importance of established business and not-for-profit organisations in providing goods
and services.
Learners will apply a number of analytical techniques, including decision-making
models, investment appraisal tools and ratio analysis, to investigate business
opportunities and problems to determine business strategy in a range of contexts.
Learners will be expected to use a range of numerical skills and make justifiable
decisions using both quantitative and qualitative methods applied in the context of
A level Business as listed in Appendix A.
The knowledge, understanding and skills are set out in two columns. The topic to be
studied is in the first column, with amplification in the second column. There is no
hierarchy implied by the order in which the content and amplification are presented,
nor should the length of the various sections be taken to imply any view of their
relative importance.
