2.3 Component 3
Appraising
Written examination: 2 hours 15 minutes (approximately)
40% of qualification
100 marks
This examination will assess knowledge and understanding of music through three
areas of study. Area of study A is compulsory and learners then choose two further
contrasting areas of study: one from either area of study B or area of study C or area of
study D, and one from either area of study E or area of study F.
Area of study A: The Western Classical Tradition (The Development of the
Symphony 1750-1900)
Choose one from:
Area of study B: Rock and Pop
Area of study C: Musical Theatre
Area of study D: Jazz.
Choose one from:
Area of study E: Into the Twentieth Century
Area of study F: Into the Twenty-first Century.
Area of study A: The Western Classical Tradition (The Development of the
Symphony 1750-1900)
Learners will study the development of the symphony for the Component 3
examination. This will include two set works:
Symphony No. 104 in D major 'London': Haydn
(Eulenberg Miniature score ISBN 13: 978-3-7957-6698-6; 978-3-7957-6523-1)
and
Symphony No. 4 in A major 'Italian': Mendelssohn
(Eulenberg Miniature score ISBN: 978-3-7957-6528-6)
Clean copies (no annotation) of the selected set work must be taken into the
examination.
Learners are required to study the development of the symphony from its emergence
in the early classical period to the close of the romantic period, 1750 to 1900. This
will initially involve a general study of both set works. This will provide a basis for a
wider study of the social, cultural and historical context. Learners will gain an
understanding of how the symphonic genre developed, using a number of examples
from different composers and different periods. Learners must then select one of the
set works for more detailed analysis.

A LEVEL MUSIC 16
Learners must demonstrate knowledge and understanding of:
• how musical elements are used in the symphony, including:
o structure (e.g. sonata form, slow movement forms, minuet and trio,
scherzo, sonata rondo, variation forms, cyclic forms and programmatic
forms)
o tonality (e.g. related keys and their function within structure)
o texture (e.g. monophony, complex combinations of musical lines such as
homophony and polyphony, imitation, counterpoint and fugue)
o melody and thematic development (e.g. phrase structure, melodic
devices such as sequence, figuration, ornamentation, augmentation and
diminution of thematic material, expansion/fragmentation of the theme,
combinations of themes, transposition, re-harmonisation and re-
orchestration of the theme)

techniques, and combination of timbres)
o harmonic language (e.g. typical harmonic progressions, use of cadences,
use of the dominant 7ths, secondary and diminished 7ths, circle of 5ths,
Neapolitan chords, augmented 6th, chromaticism, modulation and
tonicisation)
o tempo, metre and rhythm (e.g. use of accents, simple and compound
time-signatures, characteristic rhythms such as dotted rhythms, hemiola,
triplets and other divisions of the beat, syncopation and performance
directions)
o expressive use of dynamics
• the use of instrumentation and development of the orchestra in the period
including:
o the decline of basso continuo
o the influence of the Mannheim orchestra
o the occasional use of brass and percussion during early Classical period
o the initial dominance of strings with winds used for doubling, reinforcing
and filling in the harmonies
o the increased importance of the woodwind section as they were entrusted
with more important and independent material
o advances in orchestration and orchestral effects due to commissioned
works
o larger orchestral forces (especially brass and percussion)
o new sonorities (e.g. new instruments, technical improvements and use of
instrumental colour
o programmatic use of the orchestra to create and suggest underlying
meaning (e.g. orchestral landscapes, descriptive music, extremes and
subtleties of emotion)

A LEVEL MUSIC 22
Area of study F: Into the Twenty-first Century 1980-present
Learners will study the works of representative European composers from the period
as a basis for understanding how music is created, developed and performed for
different audiences in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Style in this
period is eclectic, with composers forging their own stylistic identity from a broad
range of influences (including early 20th century classical music, jazz, popular music
and minimalism).
Learners will study the following two set works in depth:
• Asyla, Movement 3 Ecstasio: Thomas Adès
(Faber Music ISBN 10: 0-571-51863-X)

(Natural Bridges): Sally Beamish
(Norsk Musikforlag ISMN: 979-0-065-12115-4)
see link to Norsk Musikforlag on WJEC website
In order to gain a breadth of understanding of how music develops in different social
and cultural contexts, the following composers, including four current British
composers, are suggested for study: Hans Werner-Henze, Witold Lutoslawski, Kaija
Saariaho, Sofia Gubaidulina, Sally Beamish, Judith Weir, Mark-Anthony Turnage and
Thomas Adès.
Learners must demonstrate knowledge and understanding of:
• how musical elements are used in composition:
o structure (e.g. how elements other than pitch have been used to provide
music with a sense of structure, the avoidance of repetition of music
even in compositions in clear-cut sections and how aleatory elements
within a composition can influence formal structure)
o tonality (e.g. extended tonality, atonality, remote key relationships and
individual composers’ approach to organising tonality, e.g.,
Lutoslawski’s 12-note chords)
o texture (e.g. how different textures can be used to help organise a
musical work)
o sonority (e.g. pointillism, increased reliance on instrumental effects and
the use of more unusual instruments such as ondes Martenot, theremin)
o melody (e.g. importance of particular intervals in a melody’s
construction, motivic and thematic development and melody without
thematic function)
o harmonic language (e.g. triads, extended chords such as 7ths/9ths,
modal harmony, octatonicism, treatment of dissonance, cluster chords
and 12-note chords)
o tempo, metre and rhythm (e.g. ‘metric modulation’, polyrhythms, the
abandonment of rhythmic notation such as in some works by Henze,
and non-metrical rhythm in aleatory music)

3.2 Arrangements for non-exam assessment
The following arrangements are for non-exam assessment in Components 1 and 2.
Component 1: Performing
This component is externally assessed by a visiting examiner.
Choice of repertoire
Each learner will select, following discussion with the centre, the pieces they will
perform for the assessment. For Option A, at least one piece must be performed as a
soloist. In addition, two pieces must show clear links to two different areas of study
and this will be indicated on the mark sheet. For Option B, one piece must show a
clear link to an area of study and this will be indicated on the mark sheet. Where a
learner chooses to perform on a non-standard or unusual instrument the centre must
provide WJEC with the name of the instrument and details of the repertoire to be
performed at least two weeks in advance of the assessment, to ensure that the
examiner is familiar with the repertoire and the technical and performance demands of
the instrument. Any instrument for which there is no graded music examination is
classed as a non-standard or unusual instrument. If in doubt about what constitutes an
unusual instrument, please contact WJEC for advice. Failure to comply could result in
the assessment being postponed.
Assessment
Component 1 assesses AO1 in its entirety.
• For option A the total mark for Component 1 is 108
• Each piece performed is marked out of 36; where more than three pieces are
offered, the total mark is divided by the number of pieces and multiplied by
three, to achieve a final mark out of 108
• For option B the total mark for Component 1 is 72
• Each piece performed is marked out of 36; where more than two pieces are
offered, the total mark is divided by the number of pieces and multiplied by two,
to achieve a final mark out of 72
• The performances will be externally assessed live by a visiting examiner
• The examiner will assess the performances using the marking criteria and
technical guidance in Appendix A of the specification
• The difficulty level of each piece will be taken into account by the examiner and
marks for each piece will be adjusted using the scaling table in appendix A
• Grade 6 or equivalent is the required standard for A level Music
• If a learner falters at the start of a piece, they will be allowed one restart (per
piece) and this will not affect the mark.
• It is vital that the total performance time has a duration of at least 10 minutes
for option A or at least 6 minutes for option B.
• A total performance time of 10 minutes for option A and 6 minutes for option B
represents 100% of the assessment requirement.
• A performance which falls below the minimum duration is penalised.

A LEVEL MUSIC 26
• Therefore, where a candidate's total performance is less than 10 minutes in
option A, or 6 minutes in option B, a proportion of the initial mark is awarded to
correlate with the proportion of the assessment requirement completed.
• This is the adjusted mark. The adjusted mark will be calculated by the visiting
examiner in 30 second increments as shown in the following tables.
• To assist visiting examiners in applying the adjustment, a mark conversion
chart is provided within Appendix A.
• While teachers are not required to assess candidates' work (and therefore
apply a penalty), this information is included in the specification to be
transparent about the process applied by visiting examiners.

• The examination will be arranged on a date convenient for the centre and will
fall sometime between March and May in the academic year in which the
learner completes the qualification.
• A circular is issued during the autumn term requesting information to enable the
examiner's visit to be scheduled.
• As A level music assesses performing, the use of a click track is not permitted
in the assessment.
Timing performances
The timing for each piece will start at the beginning of the candidate’s first note, and
end at the end of their final note. Any extended periods during the piece when the
candidate is silent will be discounted from the total performance time. Some examples
of these are given below.
• An instrumental verse in a vocal piece, where the candidate is the singer.
• An extended passage where the candidate does not play, for example in a
concerto movement.
• A solo played by another person in a jazz ensemble where the candidate is
silent.
The total performance time of each piece will be added together to give the total
performance time of the submission, and if this falls below the minimum required then
adjustments will be made using the penalty table in Appendix A.
The visiting examiner will time the performance. They will report suspected under-time
performances to WJEC and these will be checked and penalties applied if necessary.

A LEVEL MUSIC 28
Assessment evidence
Centres must populate centre and individual candidate mark sheets with names,
candidate numbers and a list of repertoire to be performed in the examination.
These must be presented to the examiner along with a running order at the start
of the session. All performances will be audio recorded by WJEC and kept as
evidence of the performance, together with the score or lead sheet for all pieces.
Please note the examiner will keep the music after the examination has finished.
It is therefore advisable to provide photocopies of the music which will be
destroyed by WJEC at a later date.

A LEVEL MUSIC 29
Component 2: Composing
This component is externally assessed by WJEC.
Composition briefs
The externally set composition briefs will be released to centres during the first week of
September in the academic year in which the assessment will be taken. There will be a
choice of four briefs. The briefs will be different every year but will always contain
details of either the occasion or the audience for which the piece must be composed.
For Option A, learners submit two compositions, one of which will be in a Western
Classical style and respond to a brief set by WJEC. The second piece will be a free
composition. For Option B, learners submit three compositions, one of which will be in
a Western Classical style and respond to a brief set by WJEC. The second
composition will reflect the musical characteristics of a different area of study and the
third is a free composition.
For both options, at least one composition allows learners to formulate their own brief. It
is important that teachers give due consideration to the choice of brief for this
composition to ensure that they allow learners to meet the assessment objective.
Learners' set briefs are not assessed. If in doubt about composition briefs, refer to the
resources and guidance on the website and examples listed in Component 2, or contact
WJEC.
Assessment
Component 2 assesses AO2 in its entirety.
• The total mark for option A is 72
• The total mark for option B is 108
• Each composition is marked out of 36
• The compositions will be externally assessed and submitted to WJEC by a specified
date in May
• The compositions must have a total duration of between 4 and 6 minutes for option
A and 8 and 10 minutes for option B
• There is no penalty for compositions which fall under the minimum time as it is
highly unlikely that compositions which are under the minimum time will be
sufficiently developed to access the higher mark bands.
• The examiner reserves the right to stop assessing a composition portfolio which
exceeds the time limit by more than 2 minutes.
• Where a learner does not respond to the brief set by WJEC to demonstrate
clear aspects of the Western Classical style, for example submitting a piece in a
Rock or Jazz style, the composition will be unlikely to achieve the higher mark
bands as it will not be an adequate response to the set brief.

Acknowledgements
All secondary source materials, such as musical quotes or pre-composed samples, must
always be clearly acknowledged and any work which is not entirely that of the learner
must be identified. Software packages must be listed with an explanation of how they
have been used. The assessor will take this information into account when marking each
composition. Where there has been over reliance on pre-recorded samples/loops, this
will result in a lower mark being awarded. Unacknowledged quotes could, in extreme
cases, result in a malpractice investigation. Any musical influences learners may have
used must also be acknowledged in the composition log.
Assessment evidence
Compositions must be submitted as a recording in mp3 or wav format with either a
notated score or a detailed written description of the composition process with a chordal
and melodic outline. It is important that assessment is rigorously monitored by centres to
ensure that learners’ work is their own. All learners are required to complete a non-
assessed composition log and sign an authentication statement endorsing the
composition as their own work: teachers must countersign the log to verify that they
have seen the work in progress on three occasions and that they have taken all
reasonable steps to validate this. Please use the log template on the WJEC website.

4 TECHNICAL INFORMATION
4.1 Making entries
This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the
course. Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series each year,
until the end of the life of this specification. Summer 2018 will be the first assessment
opportunity.
A qualification may be taken more than once. Candidates must resit all examination
components in the same series.
Marks for NEA may be carried forward for the life of the specification. If a candidate
resits an NEA component (rather than carrying forward the previous NEA mark), it is
the new mark that will count towards the overall grade, even if it is lower than a
previous attempt.
Where a candidate has certificated on two or more previous occasions, the most
recent NEA mark is carried forward, regardless of whether that mark is higher or
lower (unless that mark is absent)
The entry codes appear below.

Table of adjustments for level of difficulty of pieces
The difficulty level of each piece will be determined according to the graded music
examinations. The standard required for A level music is grade 6. The scale applies fixed
percentage adjustments which are rounded to the nearest whole number for work either
higher or lower than the standard.

Tables of adjustment for performances below the required duration
Calculating the final mark for Component 1A Performance
All performances will be marked individually by the visiting examiner according to the criteria on pages 32-33, and a total mark out of 108
calculated using the formula given.
The total time of the performances will also be calculated in minutes and seconds. The following chart will be used to determine the adjusted
mark for performing, if the total time is less than 10 minutes minus. For example, a performance of 9 minutes and 20 seconds initially awarded
a mark of 91 is given an adjusted mark of 82 because its duration falls within the 9:00-9:29 band.

Calculating the final mark for Component 1B Performance
All performances will be marked individually by the visiting examiner according to the criteria
on pages 32-33 and a total mark out of 72 calculated using the formula given.
The total time of the performances will also be calculated in minutes and seconds. The
following chart will be used to determine the adjusted mark for performing, if the total time is
less than 6 minutes. For example, a performance of 5 minutes and 40 seconds initially
awarded a mark of 50 is given an adjusted mark of 46 because its duration falls within the
5:30-5:59 band.

Further guidance for Component 2
The following information is provided as guidance for composing within the areas of
study, including compositions composed to a set brief or to a learner's own brief. The
information is not an exhaustive list of features to be found in a composition and
neither are learners expected to cover everything on the list. Learners are advised to
consider the information along with the assessment criteria when planning a
composition and assessors will consider the information when assessing the
compositions.
Area of study A: Western Classical Tradition (Baroque, Classical and
Romantic eras)
This composition is in response to a brief set by WJEC.
Through the study of set works supported by independent listening associated with
the area of study, learners are encouraged to identify relevant compositional devices,
techniques, conventions and resources which may then be incorporated and
developed in their own compositions to produce a consistent result within a clearly
recognised tonal idiom.
Learners should illustrate their musical knowledge and understanding by presenting
a composition which has depth and substance, and which reflects their experiences
in listening and performing. They need to demonstrate an appropriate musical
vocabulary, show a clear understanding and control of resources, and illustrate
thoughtful management and control of the musical elements.
Learners may wish to consider some of the following musical features associated
with the Western Classical Tradition.
• Structure/Organisation including forms such as ritornello, fugue, binary,
ternary, da capo, strophic, rondo, theme and variation, sonata, through-
composed and programme music
• Stylistic characteristics of melody and rhythm such as typical melodic
shapes, appropriate balance of phrases, melodic fluency/contrasts and
rhythmic variety/syncopation
• Devices such as imitation sequence, repetition, ostinato, expansion and
imaginative manipulation of initial material, motivic/episodic development,
inversion, augmentation, diminution and retrograde
• Texture and Timbre including layering, timbral contrasts and textural variety,
counterpoint, antiphonal writing, suitable accompaniment styles and idiomatic
writing for voices and instruments
• Tonality/Harmony such as major and minor keys and diatonic harmonies,
typical harmonic progressions, cadences, secondary and diminished 7ths,
modulation to a variety of related keys, tonicisation, circle of 5ths,
essential/unessential notes, suspensions, scales, arpeggios and a strong bass
line

A LEVEL MUSIC 47
Area of study B: Rock and Pop
Rock bands such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who developed a
louder, more amplified sound than earlier rock’n’roll, and alongside this emerged the
more commercially driven chart-based (and lighter) genre of ‘pop’ music.
Learners must identify and explore the relevant musical language in some depth to
fully understand the stylistic characteristics of rock and pop music.
Many representative songs share a number of identifiable musical features:
Musical Elements/Features Instrumentation
• Melody lead vocalist, vocal group
solo instrument, lead guitar, sax and
keyboard
• Harmony keyboard/piano/organ,
backing vocals
guitars (rhythm/acoustic)
brass section (trumpets, sax section and
trombones)
• Rhythm drum kit and additional percussion
• Bass part bass guitar, double bass, keyboard
and bass (always very distinctive)
• Structure strophic, through-composed, 12-bar,
additional sections such as Middle 8 etc
• Text it is advisable for learners to write their
own lyrics, as using words from an
existing song usually results in a melody
that is similar to the original
• Devices contrasts (in melody, texture,
mode, instrumentation, harmony etc),
layering, adding a countermelody and
balance of parts.

A LEVEL MUSIC 48
Area of study C: Musical Theatre
The integration of music and drama and the growth of musical theatre has provided a
wealth of music. Whatever type of production, the storytelling process unravels
through solos, vocal ensembles, choruses, dances, overtures and interludes.
Learners must therefore plan how their music will effectively communicate the plot,
text, situation or mood. It is extremely beneficial for learners to research different
types of musical prior to writing a brief. In this way they can decide which techniques
and practices are suitable for them to plan and develop their individual compositional
ideas.
The following musical ingredients should be considered:
• Plot Decide the setting, context, situation, text and mood prior to
planning the resources/strategies/structures/devices suitable
for the task
• Thematic Consider the text-setting, creating an appropriate melody to
material partner the words and mood, writing memorable tunes and
reflecting the mood and messages effectively
• Structure Plan the format: utilise similar rhythmic shapes, compose
memorable patterns and effective choruses and work to
achieve effective balance and shape in the outcome (e.g.
AABA, strophic, through-composed)
• Harmony Use appropriate chords, demonstrating the ability to achieve
effective harmonic structures, progressions and contrasts,
write the accompaniment using the appropriate harmonic
language, employing a suitable rate of harmonic change to
support thematic material and reflect the drama
• Resources Choose instrumentation and ensure idiomatic writing,
balance and control between both the instruments and voices,
and within the chosen textures.

A LEVEL MUSIC 49
Area of study D: Jazz
In its early twentieth century form, Jazz emerged as a fusion of African and Western
styles of music characterised by improvisation, an insistent beat, complex
syncopation, blue notes and initially simple and formulaic harmonic progressions.
This was a genre that attained a mystique of its own, capturing the imagination of a
worldwide audience. It evolved in different ways and has influenced other types of
music since about 1918.
There is a wealth of recordings available and learners should adopt both a theoretical
and practical approach in order to fully familiarise themselves with the development
of this genre. Vocal and instrumental participation and practice will further enhance
stylistic musical understanding.
For a successful reflection of this area of study, the accepted conventions of Jazz
need to be understood, and then incorporated into individual compositions.
The following suggestions may provide some guidance:
• Styles including ragtime, dixieland, early jazz, big band and be-bop
• Structures including variation form, 12/24/32 bar structures and chord
patterning (changes)
• Harmonies including blues harmonies, triadic harmonies, typical progressions,
blue-notes, 6ths, 7ths, chord extensions, various scales and modes
• Features such as break, lead-sheet, riff, scat, chorus, front-line, rhythm section,
comping, improvisation, walking bass, stab chords, back-ups, guide tones and
kicks.
Area of study E: Into the Twentieth Century
The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries witnessed a fading romanticism and
looked forward to new directions and musical challenges.
Learners are required to produce a composition which illustrates and reflects
understanding of the musical language throughout this time. It is expected that
learners will familiarise themselves and experiment with the stylistic features and
conventions of this time. Through performing and appraising, learners are
encouraged to identify relevant compositional devices and techniques which may
then be incorporated and developed in their own compositions to produce an
imaginative, substantial and consistent outcome.
The composition may be written for any ensemble or combination of sound sources,
as appropriate.

While some of the devices linked with the Western Classical Tradition may also be
utilised in this composition, learners must consider the following:
Styles Compositional Features/Devices
• Impressionism whole tone and chromatic scales, parallel chords, ninth
chords, fluid rhythms, colourful and rich orchestration,
unresolved dissonances, use of free rhythm and small-scale
programmatic forms
• Nationalism patriotic and cultural reflections, influence of folklore and folk
songs, and programmatic forms and ideas
• Neo- the use of absolute music, attention to craftsmanship and
Classicism balance with forms, contrapuntal and fugal techniques and
structures influenced by the Baroque and Classical eras
• Expressionism serial techniques and the twelve tone row, atonality,
dissonance, irregular rhythms and metres, angular melodies
and extreme registers.
Area of study F: Into the Twenty-first Century
During the present time, music is a diverse art-form. Styles are eclectic, no particular
trend is favoured and individualism is encouraged.
Polystylism (or musical eclecticism) is a growing trend in the late twentieth and early
twenty-first centuries. It combines elements of diverse musical genres and
compositional techniques into a unified and coherent body of work. Composers have
often started their musical career in one discipline and later migrated to or embraced
others, whilst retaining important elements from the former discipline.
One popular genre is that of Minimalism. This was a mid-twentieth century reaction
against the complexity of modernist compositions, and is a style which continues to
be an influence in contemporary music. Compositional features and devices of this
style include dependence on an initial cell, rhythmic interplay, phasing, and
competent manipulation of melodic cells. Learners should note that the main
characteristic of minimalism is reduction and therefore must remember that to satisfy
the requirements of the assessment criteria in composing, their work needs an
imaginative approach.
Individuality and the ability to present musical ideas effectively and confidently
through personal musical invention is the main consideration. The continuing impact
of world music, folk music, fusion of past and present styles, music for film and the
media, and electronic music all offer pathways for musical experimentation.
Learners are therefore encouraged to explore their interests, and focus on
communicating their musical ideas coherently and convincingly to achieve a stylistic
and substantial outcome in their own style.
Further ideas and examples of teaching strategies are available in the Teachers’
Guide.
