2.3 Component 3
Extended system design and realisation tasks
Non-exam assessment (NEA)
20% of qualification
70 marks
The NEA is an integral part of the WJEC Eduqas A level in Electronics and
contributes 20% to the final assessment. This component requires each learner to
complete two tasks independently. The tasks build on the concepts studied
throughout the specification and the requirements to relate practical circuit design
and realisation to knowledge and understanding gained from the study of
components 1 and 2.
Task 1 (20 marks) – involves the development of a microcontroller system
programed through assembler language.
Task 2 (50 marks) – is a substantial system development including analogue and
digital sub-systems in an integrated design.
Each task enables learners to carry out a design and realisation task based on an
individually identified problem, context or opportunity. This will be researched and
analysed by the learner to develop their own specification to clearly guide their
system development. Learners will develop their system from a series of sub-
systems which will be tested individually before assembly and testing as a complete
system. Learners must evaluate the performance of their developed system against
their specification and suggest improvements that could be made.
This component requires learners, in the context of the knowledge and
understanding in Components 1 and 2, to demonstrate their ability to:
(a) analyse a problem1 to enable solutions to be developed
(b) develop a design specification to solve a problem
(c) propose an electronic system, composed of sub-systems, to satisfy a design
specification
(d) make predictions about the way that electronic systems behave
(e) design and build an electronic system, modelling its performance against the
design specification, modifying as appropriate
(f) plan tests to make measurements, to explore a problem, selecting appropriate
techniques and instruments
(g) evaluate practical risks in system development and application
1 In the context of A level electronics skills, 'problem' is interpreted broadly, to embrace:
• problem – difficulties in a situation e.g. a person with partial hearing cannot hear the doorbell
• context – looking at situations for possible design openings e.g. a person crossing the road
• opportunity – possibilities arising e.g. from a new improved component

A LEVEL ELECTRONICS 38
(h) carry out tests having due regard to the correct manipulation of apparatus,
accuracy of measurement and Health and Safety considerations
(i) make and record measurements on electrical circuits
(j) report results using standard scientific conventions
(k) evaluate the performance of the electronic system against the design
specification
(l) suggest improvements to the electronic system following evaluation
(m) design a microcontroller system; programming the microcontroller using
assembly language (Task 1 only)
Learners should be encouraged and supported to select tasks in which they are
interested and which are neither under nor over ambitious. The focus for each of the
learner's tasks must be signed off by the teacher. The teacher should discuss the
proposed focus of the task with the learner, considering the requirements of the
assessment and the ability and interests of the individual learner. The teacher must
be satisfied that the suggested focus has the potential for the individual learner to:
• analyse the problem and derive a design specification;
• develop and test a range of sub-systems;
• develop, realise and test a final physical system;
• evaluate the final system against the design specification and suggest
improvements.
This will help ensure the task is at a suitable level for the learner concerned and will
provide that individual with a level of challenge that is appropriate to their abilities, in
the context of the requirements of an A level Electronics qualification.
Task 1
Task 1 is intended to introduce learners to software control techniques using
assembly language which is widely used to program microcontrollers for consumer
products. It is not expected that learners will be familiar with every instruction in the
instruction set, or use every programming technique available. Several
manufacturers produce PIC development systems which can be used to deliver this
part of the component. The work should not be limited to 'onscreen' design and
emulation, but must involve the actual programing of a PIC chip, and its testing
remotely on a physical circuit. Initial program testing can be carried out using a
development board to prove the program works before final testing on a physical
circuit.
The report must include a listing of the program, a description of how the program
works and testing of the program
Task 2
Once the learner has decided on a context for the task, they should undertake
appropriate research so that a list of performance parameters (specification) can be
given. It is expected that the design specification will contain realistic numerical
values against which the final performance of the system can be judged.
In each task the overall system should be developed as a number of sub-systems
which should be individually tested and evaluated before being incorporated into the
© WJEC CBAC Ltd.
A LEVEL ELECTRONICS 39
complete system. This will ensure that the complete system develops by a gradual
and incremental process, having been assessed at each stage of its development.
For microcontroller-based projects, a sub-routine can be considered as a sub-system
provided its specification can be tested and evaluated in a similar fashion to a
component-based sub-system. To meet the assessment requirements, a
microcontroller-based project will also need to include, as a minimum, some
component-based processing sub-systems for interfacing signals to and from the
microcontroller (in addition to the microcontroller circuitry).
In each task the system should be fully tested when the project is complete. The
testing should be documented with results being displayed in tables and graphs,
where appropriate. These tests will enable the learner to assess the system and
identify any faults and limitations. The learner should attempt to modify the system to
correct for any limitations and then produce a final set of performance figures for the
completed system. The learner should then evaluate the final system against the
design specification and suggest further developments.
The learner should fully document the development of each task in a report. It is the
evidence contained within this report and the system produced upon which the NEA
should be marked and assessed. The report should contain evidence for each task of
the following sections:
• System planning – including analysis of the problem and a design specification
• System development – including the development of the system in terms of sub-
systems, annotated circuit diagrams and description of testing each sub-system
and the recording of results
• System realisation – including annotated block and circuit diagrams; evidence of
layout planning; description of testing of complete systems and the recording of
results and user guide
• Evaluation – including a detailed evaluation of the system against the design
specification and suggestions for improvement.
The report should be presented in a logical order that is clearly presented and easy
to understand. It should contain an acknowledgement of all sources of information
and help. Photographs of the complete physical system must be included in the
report.
Physical circuit
Construction of both systems may be on prototype board, strip board or printed
circuit board. Whichever method of construction is chosen, the layout and mounting
of components and wiring should be neat and logical, assist the design, allow testing
of and fault finding of the system. Pre-constructed circuit boards such as PIC or
Arduino development boards are not acceptable as the final circuit.
Supervision
The tasks must be appropriately supervised to ensure that teachers are able to
confidently authenticate each learner’s work. Learners are allowed supervised
access to resources that may include information gathered outside supervised time.
Each learner must produce their NEA under immediate supervision.
© WJEC CBAC Ltd.
A LEVEL ELECTRONICS 40
Each learner must produce their system under 'immediate supervision'. This means
the system has to be produced either:
(i) with the simultaneous physical presence of the learner and the
supervisor,
or
(ii) remotely by means of simultaneous electronic communication.
In most cases supervision will be of the form described in (i), but in some
circumstances, for example if the learner is carrying out a specialist process away
from the centre, (ii) may be more appropriate.
Appendix D gives guidance on the level of independence in NEA tasks.
Time allocation
The NEA is integral to WJEC Eduqas A level Electronics and contributes 20% to the
final assessment. Time is not prescribed for this work because the process of the
learner's independent design and realisation tasks are iterative. They include the
design, prototyping, testing and evaluating of sub-systems and systems, alongside
the writing of the task reports. Learners should seek guidance from their teachers
and engage as necessary in learner-led discussions. Teachers should make time
available for the following:
• to explain the requirements of the independent design and construction task
• to guide learners to an appropriate context
• to direct learners to the assessment objectives relevant to the assessment of the
component
• to analyse Health and Safety considerations and the risk assessment of practical
work.
As a consequence, the overall time allocated to the independent design and
realisation tasks both by teacher and learners should be commensurate with a 20%
weighting of the whole qualification for this component.

3.2 Arrangements for non-exam assessment
Marking of extended system design and realisation tasks
Marks should be awarded for the criteria listed in the assessment grids for non-exam
assessment (see Appendix E).
Exemplification statements are given in the mark grid to indicate the features which
should be present in a candidate’s work to be awarded full marks for that section and
the level.
A 'level of response' mark scheme is used. The relevant section(s) of the candidate's
work should be read from start to finish before applying the mark scheme. Then the
work should be matched to the level descriptors to decide which descriptor matches
best with the candidate’s work, whilst remembering to consider the overall quality of
the response. Next, which mark to award within the band needs to be determined. If
there is a good match with the content (and, where relevant, the communication
statements for QER) then the highest mark for the band should be awarded. Lower
marks within the band should be awarded for proportionately weaker matches with
the content for the band.
It is the responsibility of the centre to ensure the authenticity of all work presented for
assessment. All candidates are required to sign an authentication statement
endorsing the originality of their work presented for assessment, and assessors must
countersign that they have taken all reasonable steps to validate this. Authentication
documentation must be completed by all candidates, not just those selected for
moderation.
Marks should only be awarded for work which is that of the candidate. Any
assistance that goes beyond general guidance must be recorded on the Electronics
task form and taken into account when marking the work.
Marks should only be awarded when there is supporting evidence. Supervisors must
annotate each candidate's Electronics task form and/or the relevant section of the
work to identify the location of relevant evidence. Annotation should also be provided
to indicate to what degree the final performance met the initial specification.
For each task the candidate's report must contain clear photographic evidence of the
completed circuit.
The centre is responsible for carrying out internal standardisation where two or more
teachers have been involved in the marking of the work submitted for a single unit.
Moderation of NEA
Once the centre has marked all candidates’ work, the marks must be entered into the
online system for each individual and sent electronically to WJEC. The online system
will then select and return the candidates identified for the moderation sample.
For each candidate in the sample, the moderator must be sent a completed
Electronics task form with the task reports and photographic evidence of the
completed physical systems. The Electronics task form will be available on the WJEC
website.

4 TECHNICAL INFORMATION
4.1 Making entries
This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the
course. Assessment opportunities will be available in May/June each year, until the
end of the life of this specification. Summer 2019 will be the first assessment
opportunity.
A qualification may be taken more than once. Candidates must resit all examination
components in the same series.
Marks for NEA may be carried forward for the life of the specification. If a candidate
resits an NEA component (rather than carrying forward the previous NEA mark), it is
the new mark that will count towards the overall grade, even if it is lower than a
previous attempt.
Where a candidate has certificated on two or more previous occasions, the most
recent NEA mark is carried forward, regardless of whether that mark is higher or
lower (unless that mark is absent)
