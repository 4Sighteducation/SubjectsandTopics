Non-exam assessment accounts for 20% of this A level. In this specification, non-
exam assessment is a project. This is a substantial piece of work, undertaken over
an extended period of time.
Component 3 for the A level examination requires the candidate to discuss,
investigate, design, prototype, refine the design, implement, test and evaluate a
computerised solution to a problem chosen by the candidate.
The work undertaken in this component will be the discussion, investigation, design,
prototyping, refinement of design, implementation, testing and evaluation of a
solution to a problem chosen by the candidate. It should demonstrate the discussion,
investigation, design, prototyping, refinement of design, implementation, testing and
evaluation skills involved in problem solving using a computer and include the
development of a piece of work over an extended period of time. The candidate
should produce a word-processed report of the work carried out.

A LEVEL COMPUTER SCIENCE 22
During the discussion stage of the project, candidates should discuss their intended
task with teachers and peers prior to commencing the investigation; the teacher
should note the intended scope of candidates’ projects at this stage.
Following the prototype stage of the project, candidates are required to discuss their
prototype in technical terms with their teacher and peers. The teacher should make a
note of candidate progress and understanding of the work produced. Peers may offer
feedback on the work at this stage.
The work for Component 3 must include the development of software in either a
general purpose or a special purpose high-level language. The system proposed by
the candidate may consist of one integrated program or a suite of related programs.
The candidate's teacher will be expected to mark the candidate's work and note on
the Centre Mark Sheet the nature of any assistance given and the extent to which the
solution actually works as stated in the report. Candidate work and documentation
may be annotated by the teacher in order to justify marks awarded.
The assessment grids
When assessing Component 3, teachers should study the assessment grids
(Appendix B), which are designed to present a system that links the assessment
objectives to marks, and which helps to discriminate clearly between the varying
levels of achievement.
The grids will be of most value when used in conjunction with examples of non-exam
assessment which will be issued annually to help centres identify the quality of work
associated with the various mark bands.
Teachers must make specific reference to the assessment objectives in the
comments they write on the work and on the coversheets.
Submission of assessments
Candidate work for Component 3 should be submitted to WJEC electronically. The
submission should include a functioning copy of the solution and supporting
documents in portable document format (pdf).
Candidates should make use of the electronic front sheet saved in html format.
Each heading on the sheet should be hyperlinked to a pdf version of the write-up for
that particular requirement of the specification.
Each candidate’s work should be saved in a separate folder labelled with the centre
number, candidate number and the first two initials of the candidate's surname and
the first initial of the candidate’s first name. For example, Diane Smith, Centre
number 68999, candidate number 12345 would store her work in a folder named
68999_12345_SM_D.
The candidate may wish to use sub folders to organise their work for each section
and must ensure that the front sheet is stored in such a way that the hyperlinks allow
the assessor and moderator to access the relevant pdf documents.
The centre assessor should store the candidate’s assessment documentation using
the same naming convention as above, but with the addition of CS3. For example
Diane Smith’s assessment documentation would be stored as
CS3_68999_12345_SM_D.
Further details will be issued by WJEC each year.

A LEVEL COMPUTER SCIENCE 23
Annotation and supporting evidence
Centres are required to provide information that enables the moderator to check the
work against the assessment criteria. This information should be given on the Centre
Mark Sheet.
Annotation should, therefore:
• describe, in all necessary detail, practical work that is not available, together with
comments from the teacher
• explain where candidates have received help beyond the normal learning support
that may influence the assessments
• highlight those key areas that have led to the recognition of particular criteria.
Reference to the assessment criteria is particularly helpful
• include any other notes that will help the moderator to assess the work.
Supervision and authentication
Unfair practice
Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of
WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any
unfair practice in the preparation of work required for assessment. They must
understand that to present material copied directly from books or other sources
without acknowledgement will be regarded as deliberate deception. Centres must
report suspected malpractice to WJEC.
If WJEC is satisfied that the regulations have been breached, the candidate may be
disqualified from all subjects. Candidates will be required to certify that they have
read and understood the regulations relating to unfair practice.
Supervision of work
Centres must assure WJEC that the assessments submitted are the work of the
candidates concerned. For Component 3 as much work as possible must be
undertaken under the direct supervision of teachers.
The teacher responsible for the supervision of the candidate's work must complete a
declaration, certifying that the marks submitted were awarded in accordance with the
specification and Instructions and Guidance for Teachers, and that she/he is entirely
satisfied that the work submitted is that of the candidate concerned.
It is acceptable for parts of a candidate's work to be taken from other sources as long
as all such cases are clearly identified in the text and fully acknowledged either on
the Centre Mark Sheet or in the supporting evidence. Where phrases, sentences or
longer passages are quoted directly from a source, candidates should use quotation
marks.
Centres entering candidates for A level Computer Science must accept the obligation
to provide sufficient supervision to enable them to give an assurance that every step
has been taken to ensure that the work submitted is that of the candidate concerned.
When a candidate has need of assistance in completing a particular piece of work,
such assistance should be given but the teacher must add appropriate comments on
the Centre Mark Sheet.

A LEVEL COMPUTER SCIENCE 24
It is expected that the teacher will be involved at the following stages:
• Initial discussion at the time when the component is being introduced and
work is being planned. The final choice of the proposed method of solution
should be that of the individual candidate, but the teacher will be expected to
discuss the proposed choice so that guidance can be given about suitability
and appropriateness before work begins. It is anticipated that such advice will
ensure that the solution attempted is neither trivial nor over-ambitious.
• Following the prototype stage, the prototype solution and code produced
should be discussed with the candidate. The teacher will be expected to
discuss the functionality of the prototype and the candidate’s understanding of
the code produced. The teacher should note and investigate instances where
the candidate is not able to sufficiently explain how the prototype or code in
their solution functions. Please see notes on authentication for more
information.
• Periodic supervision and discussion as appropriate, e.g. discussion of the
availability and use of material, suitable annotations on the work.
• Guidance on the presentation of the component, including the information to
be given on the Centre Mark Sheet.

A LEVEL COMPUTER SCIENCE 25
Authentication
It is important that non-exam assessment is rigorously monitored by centres to
ensure that candidates' work is their own. All candidates are required to sign that
the work submitted is their own and teachers/assessors are required to confirm that
the work assessed is solely that of the candidate concerned and was conducted
under the required conditions. A copy of the authentication form, which forms part of
the cover sheet for each candidate's work will be provided by WJEC. It is important to
note that all candidates are required to sign this form, and not merely those whose
work forms part of the sample submitted to the moderator. Malpractice discovered
prior to the candidate signing the declaration of authentication need not be reported
to WJEC but must be dealt with in accordance with the centre's internal procedures.
Before any work towards the non-exam assessment is undertaken, the attention of
candidates should be drawn to the relevant JCQ Notice to Candidates. This is
available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk) and included in Instructions for
Conducting Coursework. More detailed guidance on the prevention of plagiarism is
given in Plagiarism in Examinations; Guidance for Teachers/Assessors also available
on the JCQ website.
Submission of marks
Centres need to submit marks for internally assessed work online during the summer
term of the year when the work is to be submitted for moderation. When the marks
have been submitted to WJEC, the online system will apply the sample formula
based on the overall rank order for the total entry and immediately identify the sample
of learners whose work is selected for moderation.
Internal standardisation and moderation
It is essential that where there is more than one teacher in a centre, work from all
teaching groups is standardised internally. This is designed to ensure that the final
assessment reflects a single agreed standard for all teaching groups involved.
Moderation will normally take place in June. All centres will receive detailed
feedback from the moderation.

This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the
course. Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series each year,
until the end of the life of this specification. Summer 2017 will be the first
assessment opportunity.
A qualification may be taken more than once. Candidates must resit all examination
components in the same series.
Marks for NEA may be carried forward for the life of the specification. If a candidate
resits an NEA component (rather than carrying forward the previous NEA mark), it is
the new mark that will count towards the overall grade, even if it is lower than a
previous attempt.
Where a candidate has certificated on two or more previous occasions, the most
recent NEA mark is carried forward, regardless of whether that mark is higher or
lower (unless that mark is absent)

Component 3 – Programmed solution to a problem
Sample Task
Tasks for Component 3 will take a variety of forms depending on the scenario chosen by the
candidate. The following scenario gives an example of a task that would permit the scope
expected from an A level candidate.
Bridgewest Triathlon Club
Bridgewest Triathlon Club is a thriving organisation that is well supported and regularly
enters both men’s and women’s teams in local and national competitions. The best
triathletes need to be extremely fit to take part in these races that follow the Olympic format
of three disciplines, a 1,500 metre swim, a 40 kilometre bike ride and a 10 km run. On
average the swimming takes about 20% of the time taken to finish with the bike ride taking
50% and the run 30% of the time.
These athletes will follow a training program that includes two sessions training for each
discipline each week. They also need to ensure that as they near the end of their training
before a competition that they train over the distances covered in a triathlon. However, it is
important that they have 1 – 2 days with no training per week to prevent injuries.
The club trainer tries to keep accurate records of athletes’ training for each event. The
trainer knows that the records are not always accurate which causes issues for the club.
Records of athletes’ finishing times are kept for each event entered and it is important that
the trainer can compare an athlete’s training times for each event to be able to design the
best programme to help them succeed.
The trainer has asked me to create a computer-based solution that will allow her to:
• Enter and store the personal details of each athlete
• Enter and save baseline times for each athlete for
o 1,500 metre swim
o 40 kilometre bike ride
o 10 kilometre run
• Record the length of each training session for the chosen discipline for each athlete
• Calculate average speed for the chosen discipline for each training session for each
athlete
• Compare training speeds for each training session per discipline
• Record the events entered and the time for each discipline and the finishing time for
each event
• Record the final results of each discipline in the actual triathlon
• Compare baseline time and final result for each discipline and presents results in a user
friendly format
• Identify fastest athlete overall for each discipline
• Identify most effective training regime based on the split times for each discipline and
the combined time for the actual triathlon

Banded mark schemes
Banded mark schemes are divided so that each band has a relevant descriptor. The descriptor for the
band provides a description of the performance level for that band. Each band contains marks.
Before marking, assessors should first read and annotate a learner’s project to pick out the evidence
that is being assessed. Once the annotation is complete, the mark scheme can be applied.
This is done as a two stage process.
Stage 1 – Deciding on the band
When deciding on a band, the work should be viewed holistically. Beginning at the lowest band,
assessors should look at the appropriate section of the learner’s project and check whether it
matches the descriptor for that section’s mark band. Assessors should look at the descriptor for that
band and see if it matches the qualities shown in the learner’s work for that section. If the descriptor
at the lowest band is satisfied, assessors should move up to the next band and repeat this process
for each band until the descriptor matches the work.
If a learner’s work covers different aspects of different bands within the mark scheme, a ‘best fit’
approach should be adopted to decide on the band and then the learner’s work should be used to
decide on the mark within the band. For instance if work is mainly in band 2 but with a limited amount
of band 3 content, the work would be placed in band 2, but the mark awarded would be close to the
top of band 2 as a result of the band 3 content. Assessors should not seek to mark candidates down
as a result of small omissions in minor areas of their work.
Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark
Once the band has been decided, assessors can then assign a mark. WJEC Eduqas will provide
exemplar material already awarded a mark, and this should be used as reference material when
assessing the work.
When marking, assessors can use these examples to decide whether a learner’s work is of a
superior, inferior or comparable standard to the example. Assessors are reminded of the need to
revisit the work as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark
allocated is appropriate to the work submitted.
Where work is not credit worthy, that is, contains nothing of any significance to the project, or has
been omitted, no marks should be awarded.

Mathematical skills
Computer science uses mathematics to express its computational laws and processes.
This specification in computer science contains a minimum of 10% mathematics as required
by the regulator. Students are asked to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding
and skills of computational processes and problem-solving in both theoretical and practical
ways. The following list shows the key concepts that will be common to all specifications in
computer science.
For each topic below, while the concepts are Level 2 (though not all appear in GCSE
Mathematics specifications), students will, however, be expected to apply the skills they
acquire in a Level 3 context.
Topics:
• Boolean algebra
• Comparison of complexity of algorithms
• Number representations and bases
