1. Assessment of practical performance
Candidates must be assessed in one of the approved activities as stipulated by DfE
in Appendix B.
Candidates can be assessed at intervals throughout the course. The final mark
submitted should be a true reflection of the candidates' performance.
For assessment as a player/performer candidates should:
demonstrate the application of relevant skills/techniques required for the
sport/activity. All activities should be played under competitive/formal conditions
appropriate to the activity.
For assessment as a coach candidates should:
plan and deliver coaching sessions appropriate to developing specific aspects of
performance. There should be evidence of progression in the sessions.
The performances must be internally assessed by the teacher using the assessment
grids in Appendix A. The performances are externally moderated by a visiting
moderator. Candidates can offer an off-site activity for assessment.
Off-site activities are those that do not take place at the school/college campus and
where there it would be difficult to moderate "live" on moderation day. Appropriate
DVD evidence must be available for the performance of all off-site activities.
Teachers must ensure that the appropriate assessment criteria are used for all
activities.
Please note that to enable centres to review the outcome of moderation, each
centre must complete an audio-visual recording of all the performances seen
on moderation day.
Following moderation, the audio-visual recording should be sent to WJEC within one
week of the moderation visit. WJEC will keep it for sufficient time to allow for the
completion of relevant enquiries about results and appeals.

A LEVEL PHYSICAL EDUCATION 27
Reasonable adjustments
Any specific access arrangements must be agreed before assessment takes place. Access
arrangements are designed to enable learners with special educational needs, disabilities or
temporary injuries to be assessed.
WJEC will make reasonable adjustments where a disabled candidate would otherwise be at
a substantial disadvantage in comparison to someone who is not disabled. Access
arrangements will allow reasonable adjustments to take place. However while one of the
main concerns of suitable access arrangements is the needs of the learner, the other is the
necessity of ensuring that the integrity of the assessment is not compromised.
Centres who wish to apply for reasonable adjustments must do so via Access arrangements
online in the first instance. In the case of injuries, WJEC should be contacted as soon as
possible. Learners will then know at the earliest possible point what access arrangements
are in place.
Any reasonable adjustment that has been authorised will apply to both the internal
assessment by teachers and to moderation day. The visiting moderator will be informed of
the adjustments ahead of the visit and will comply with any arrangements that are in place.
Please note that an adjustment will only be made if it is deemed to be reasonable e.g. if it
does not affect the integrity of the assessment, does not involve unreasonable costs to
WJEC or does not impact unreasonably on other learners.
Full details can be found in JCQs regulations and guidance on Access Arrangements and
Reasonable Adjustments http://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/access-arrangements-and-
special-consideration/regulations-and-guidance which is updated annually.

A LEVEL PHYSICAL EDUCATION 28
Recording practical performances
The following guidance applies to all instances when recorded evidence is required, this
includes evidence for off-site activities filmed prior to moderation day and all activities
recorded during the moderator visit.
To ensure that there is appropriate evidence for assessment it is essential that the following
procedures should be adhered to:
• All candidates should be introduced at the start of each performance providing their
name, candidate number, and if appropriate, how they will be identified during the
performance e.g. blue 4 in a team game
• The evidence should be produced in an easy to access format such as DVD so that
the moderator can easily view the recording and WJEC can use for
moderation/standardising purposes
• The recorder should be familiar with the assessment criteria to ensure that all
aspects of the assessment requirements are recorded. This may require using wide
angled shots as well as close ups depending on the activity being filmed
• After assessment, check the recordings, back them up
• Save the recording clearly identifying both on the cover and on the DVD, the centre
number and qualification
Recording team games
For a whole game the camera should follow the action although, in discussion with
moderators, it might be appropriate to follow individuals for some of the period of play.
Although WJEC requires assessment in a full game situation the difficulties of filming
sufficient evidence is recognised. Therefore it is recommended that performances in small
sided/conditioned situations are also filmed to supplement the evidence from the full game.
Recording swimming in public pools
If a public swimming pool is to be used, a centre should approach the management of the
pool to discuss arrangements. If filming in a public pool does take place the following
procedures should be followed:
• Adhere strictly to the pool's guidelines/policy on recording
• Permission must be obtained from the parents/guardians of the participants
• Other pool users should be informed and consent to the recording (this may be done
as part of the pool's own guidelines/policies)
It is the responsibility of the centre to provide evidence for every candidate; either live at
moderation or a recorded off-site activity. Therefore if the difficulties of recording at public
pools prove to be impossible for a centre to overcome, candidates should not be entered for
assessment in swimming.

A LEVEL PHYSICAL EDUCATION 29
2. Assessment of analysis and evaluation of personal performance
The personal performance analysis and evaluation must aim to provide
recommendations to improve performance in the practical assessed activity. The
performance analysis and evaluation must be internally assessed by the teacher
using the relevant assessment grid in Appendix A.
Non-exam assessment of analysis and evaluation of personal performance enables
candidates to:
• pursue wider reading during the course
• undertake independent and sustained study
• undertake research in exploring factors that could help improve
candidates own performance
• explore connections between theory and practice
It is important that centres give due consideration to the written non-exam
assessment to ensure that they make full use of the opportunity to allow candidates
to display independence and those skills necessary for attainment at the highest
levels of performance.
Advisory Word Count
An advisory word count of 2500-3500 words is recommended.
Candidates are expected to follow the guidelines on the length of work as stated in
this specification. Candidates who offer work that is too short are penalising
themselves by not allowing appropriate coverage of the required assessment
objectives. Candidates who exceed the advisory word count are penalising
themselves through a lack of precision and focus.
Candidates are required to record the total word count on the coversheet.
Time
Sufficient time must be allocated to enable candidates to complete the following:
1. An initial analysis of personal performance identifying and undertaking
appropriate research into an area of subject content in the specification
2. An evaluation of the research, including data, to make recommendations and
a plan for improving performance
3. An analysis of the effectiveness of the training programme, following its
completion
4. An evaluation of the programme identifying strategies to improve future
performance
Following the completion of the initial analysis, research and evaluation of the
research, a period of at least 10 weeks should be allowed for candidates to complete
the training programme. During this period candidates should monitor their own
progress. They should then complete the analysis and evaluation of the training
programme. WJEC recommend that a total of fifteen assessment hours are
required for completion of all of stages 1 to 4 to produce work of the advisory word
count of 2500-3500 words.
Guidance
Teachers must ensure that the initial analysis and data collected is sufficient and is
applied to the assessed practical activity. Teachers may give generic advice on data
collection and appropriate areas of research but not indicate how improvements can
be made. Teachers should regularly check that candidates have followed the
planned programme.

Acknowledgements
References to sources must be clearly acknowledged: by direct reference if a
quotation is used; and by an appended bibliography. The bibliography will not be
included as part of the advisory word count.
Drafting
Guidance may be given by teachers in the re-drafting of the works but this must only
consist of general observations. That is, teachers can suggest in broad terms where
improvements could be made but should not indicate how. There should be no
indications of errors, omissions and ways to improve the work. The candidate must
decide independently what must be improved and how. Once the analysis and
evaluation is finally submitted and marked the work must not be further revised.
Plagiarism
Centres are required to be vigilant and to refuse to award marks or submit for
moderation any work which they consider not to be the candidate’s own. Candidates
will be penalised for any attempt to plagiarise. General advice and guidance on how
to proceed if plagiarism is suspected can be found on the JCQ website.
Authentication
It is important that all non-exam assessments are rigorously monitored by centres to
ensure that all candidates' work is their own. When the written work has been
completed it must not be returned to candidates for any changes to be made. The
work must be kept securely within the centre.
• All candidates are required to sign an authentication statement endorsing
the practical performance and the analysis and evaluation as their own
• Centres must countersign that they have taken all reasonable steps to
validate this
• An authentic teacher signature must be used; counter signed by a senior
member of staff
• Documentation must be completed for all candidates' work, not just for
those selected for the sample to be seen by the moderator
• All documentation will be available on the physical education homepage
on the WJEC website
Standardisation of internal assessment
It is essential that where there is more than one teacher in a centre, work from all
teaching groups is standardised internally. This is designed to ensure that the final
assessment reflects a single agreed standard for all teachers and teaching groups.

A LEVEL PHYSICAL EDUCATION 31
Moderation Process
• WJEC provides an annual administrative handbook for centres, outlining how
assessments should be undertaken in centres
• Moderation will take place by between the middle of March and May of the
year of examination.
• WJEC will confirm the date of the moderation with all centres before the end
of December of the examination year.
• Prior to the visit, centres will have completed all mark sheets, which will be
available on the website, and forwarded them to WJEC by a date to be
confirmed in early March.
• Mark sheets should include marks for the practical performances and the
performance analysis and evaluation.
• WJEC will decide on activities and candidates to be seen at moderation and
will notify centres in advance of the visit.
• A timetable will be sent by centres to WJEC in advance of the visit.
• The moderators will see a representative sample of the practical activities
offered.
• All candidates should be present on the day of moderation.
• Candidates must be clearly identified by number.
• All performance analyses and evaluations must be marked and available for
the moderator on the day of the moderation visit.
• Authentication documents must accompany every performance analysis and
evaluation.
• A representative sample of the performance analysis and evaluation covering
the ability range will be selected by the moderators and taken away for
external moderation.
Absence from moderation
It is a requirement that all candidates selected as part of the sample will attend
moderation. However the nature of physical education and sport is that there will
occasionally be injuries which mean that candidates will not be able to play an active
part in the moderation day.
In the case of injuries sustained during the course which makes participation at
moderation impossible, the following procedures must be followed:
• Centres must inform WJEC about the nature and extent of the injury as soon
as possible
• Centres must confirm that there is a genuine reason for the proposed non –
attendance of the candidate and retain evidence within the centre
• WJEC will, in most instances, request that another candidate with similar
marks attends moderation
• If possible the injured candidate should attend moderation day
• The injured candidate's analysis and evaluation work must be available on the
moderation day for the moderator to assess
Centres must ensure that all necessary equipment and facilities will be available on
the day of moderation. The moderators should be made aware of any activity which
is to be moderated at an off-site venue.
All centres will receive a report on the moderation which will be available
electronically on GCE results day.

4 TECHNICAL INFORMATION
4.1 Making entries
This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the
course. Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series each year,
until the end of the life of this specification. Summer 2018 will be the first
assessment opportunity.
A qualification may be taken more than once. Candidates must resit all examination
components in the same series.
Marks for NEA may be carried forward for the life of the specification. If a candidate
resits an NEA component (rather than carrying forward the previous NEA mark), it is
the new mark that will count towards the overall grade, even if it is lower than a
previous attempt.
Where a candidate has certificated on two or more previous occasions, the most
recent NEA mark is carried forward, regardless of whether that mark is higher or
lower (unless that mark is absent)
The entry code appears below.

APPENDIX A
Component 3 assessment grids
Component 3 assesses assessment objective 4 in its entirety; it will be marked out of 90 and
is worth 30% of the qualification.
Guidance on using assessment grids
Banded assessment grids are divided so that each band has a relevant descriptor. The
descriptor for the band provides a description of performance level for that band. Each band
contains marks.
The mark scheme should be applied as a two stage process.
Stage 1 – Deciding on the band
Beginning at the lowest band, teachers should look at the learner’s performance/work and
check whether it matches the descriptor for that band. If the descriptor at the lowest band is
satisfied, teachers should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band
until the descriptor matches the work.
If a learner's work/performance covers different aspects of different bands within the mark
scheme, a ‘best fit’ approach should be adopted to decide on the band and then the
learner’s response should be used to decide on the mark within the band. For instance if the
performance/work is mainly in band 2 but with a limited amount of band 3 content, the
answer would be placed in band 2, but the mark awarded would be close to the top of band
2 as a result of the band 3 content. Teachers should not seek to mark learners down as a
result of small omissions in minor areas.
Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark
Once the band has been decided, teachers can then assign a mark. Teachers should revisit
the performance/work as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and
the mark allocated is appropriate to the level of work/performance.

Analysis and evaluation of performance
The marking grid on the following pages is to be used in the assessment of the analysis and
evaluation of personal performance.
The analysis and evaluation should help the learner to improve personal performance as a
player/performer or coach. It must be linked to the chosen practical activity and contain
research into appropriate theoretical subject content. Quantitative skills that are relevant to
the learners' chosen analysis and evaluation should be integrated into the assignment. See
Appendix C for the list of quantitative skills.
The following stages should be followed:
1. An initial analysis of personal performance identifying and undertaking appropriate
research into an area of subject content in the specification
2. An evaluation of the research, including data, to make recommendations and a plan for
improving performance
3. An analysis of the effectiveness of the training programme, following its completion
4. An evaluation of the programme identifying strategies to improve future performance
The analysis and evaluation has a total of 45 marks. Each of the four stages has a discrete
mark solely targeting either analysis or evaluation as can be seen on the following pages.
Of the 45 marks, 4 are awarded for the use of quantitative skills. The assessment grids
clearly show where consideration is given for the use of quantitative skills. Teachers should
ensure that the chosen study enables learners to generate, analyse and evaluate data so
that marks for quantitative skills can be accessed.
An important aspect of the analysis and evaluation is the identifying, carrying out and
evaluation of research into an aspect of subject content that will improve performance.
Teachers should ensure that the chosen study will enable learners to access appropriate
research materials that can contribute to improving their performance.
