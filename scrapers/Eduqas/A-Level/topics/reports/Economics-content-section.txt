The subject content has been grouped into three broad areas of study:
 Microeconomics
 Macroeconomics
 Trade and development.
Learners are required to understand that economics is a study of scarce resources and how
those resources are allocated to various uses in a market economy. Learners will also be
required to understand the economic behaviour of consumers, producers and governments
in competitive and non-competitive markets. Learners need to be aware of the assumptions
of the model of demand and supply and explain the way it works using a range of
techniques. Learners need an understanding of the benefits of markets and how they work
and why they may fail.
Learners should understand the way prices and outputs are set in a variety of competitive
and non-competitive situations and should be able to model this using cost and revenue
models. Learners should be aware that the objectives of different economic agents may not
always be simple maximisation and these objectives may change according to time and
circumstance. Learners should understand the ways in which and the extent to which
governments need to act to control the behaviour of firms.
Learners will need to study the content areas below:
 Scarcity and choice
 Demand and supply in product markets
 Demand and supply in labour markets
 Resource allocation
 Costs, revenues and profits
 Market structures
 Market failure.

Learners are required to understand the use of economic models to develop a critical
understanding of macroeconomic issues. Learners must develop an awareness of the
historical context of economic ideas and theories and understand government objectives and
policies as they relate to stability and growth in local, national and global terms.
Learners need to understand that there is significant theoretical debate over the extent to
which an economy can achieve full employment equilibrium – specifically, the belief among
Keynesians that economies can reach an equilibrium below full employment compared to
Neo-Classical economists who believe that an economy will automatically adjust to full
employment equilibrium. Learners need to understand and evaluate the different policy
options used by governments as a result of this difference of opinion.
Learners should have an awareness of major economic issues that have taken place since
1990 to the present day.
Learners will need to study the content areas below:

relief, government intervention in the
form of policies such as import and
export substituting industrialisation
and encouraging FDI
