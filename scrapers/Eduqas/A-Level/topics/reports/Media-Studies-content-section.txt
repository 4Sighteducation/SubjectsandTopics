2.2 Component 2
Media Forms and Products in Depth
Written examination: 2 hours 30 minutes
35% of qualification
90 marks
Overview
In this component learners are required to study three media forms in depth,
exploring all areas of the theoretical framework - media language, representation,
media industries, and audiences - in relation to audio-visual, print and online
products set by WJEC. The forms to be studied in depth are:
• television
• magazines
• blogs and websites.
Learners will explore these three media forms through close analysis of the set
products, comparing their use of media language and the representations they offer
in relation to relevant social, cultural, economic, political and historical contexts.
Learners will study the role of media industries in shaping media products, as well as
considering the way in which both mass and specialised audiences are targeted and
addressed. Relevant and advanced theories will inform study of the set products and
learners will reflect critically upon these theoretical perspectives. Learners should
continue to develop their ability to use relevant subject-specific terminology in this
component.
Learners will develop the ability to:
• analyse critically and compare how media products, including products outside
the commercial mainstream, construct and communicate meanings through the
interaction of media language and audience response
• use and reflect critically upon a range of complex theories of media studies and
use specialist subject-specific terminology appropriately in a developed way
• debate critically key questions relating to the social, cultural, political and
economic role of the media through sustained discursive writing
• construct and develop a sustained line of reasoning which is coherent, relevant,
substantiated and logically structured in an extended response.
Section A: Television in the Global Age
Television today is a global industry. The international popularity of genres like
Nordic noir, the global reach of streaming services such as Netflix and Apple TV+,
and the growing number of international co-productions reflect the increasingly
transnational outlook of television in the global age.
Through an in-depth study of two contrasting programmes produced in different
social and cultural contexts, learners will explore the dynamics that shape
contemporary television production, distribution and circulation. The role of public
service broadcasting in a global marketplace will be considered, as learners will
explore the significance of the economic and industry contexts in which the set
products are produced. The way in which the television industry is regulated and the
marketing strategies used to promote the set products will also be investigated.
Learners will also have opportunities to explore how the television audience is
defined, constructed and targeted on both a national and a global scale.

A LEVEL MEDIA STUDIES 27
In addition, the particular appeal of the programmes for audiences will be
investigated, and issues such as fandom and the way in which audiences use media
texts will also be considered.
Whilst there is a specific focus on contemporary television programmes here,
learners will also examine the way in which these products relate to broader cultural
and historical contexts, analysing their use of media language and the cultural and
ideological significance of the representations they offer.
For example, learners who study Option 1 will be able to consider the way in which The
Bridge uses the conventions of earlier crime drama traditions such as film noir whilst
exploring contemporary social, cultural and political issues. Similarly, in Option 2,
learners will be able to consider the way in which Black Mirror use the established genre
conventions of science-fiction to explore contemporary cultural issues and anxieties,
whilst, in Option 3, learners will be able to analyse the way in which the set products
draw on the way in which spy thrillers such as Killing Eve and Tehran relate to the wider
social and cultural contexts in which they are produced. Genre is therefore a particular
focal point here, as learners will consider the extent to which the set products support
Steve Neale’s proposition that genres are best understood as processes which may be
‘dominated by repetition’, but are also ‘marked fundamentally by variation, difference and
change.’

Section B: Magazines – Mainstream and Alternative Media
The magazine industry in the UK is a highly challenging media environment, with thousands
of titles competing for readers and market space. Here, learners will study two magazines in
depth, developing an understanding of the contextual factors that shape their production,
distribution, circulation and consumption, as well as considering the historical, social, and
cultural significance of the representations they offer. Learners will also explore how media
language incorporates viewpoints and ideologies.
Each option includes two magazines that have been produced within different historical and
industry contexts and that target different audiences. One of the magazines will be
contemporary, whilst the other will have been produced before 1970; one will be a
commercial magazine with mainstream appeal, whilst the other will have been produced
outside the commercial mainstream. The magazines in each option therefore offer rich
opportunities for comparative analysis.
Set Options for Magazines
One option (including both products) from the following must be chosen:

Section C: Media in the Online Age
In a world increasingly dominated by digital technology, online, social and participatory
media have become an integral part of the contemporary media landscape. The growing
cultural significance of online platforms is evident in the number of subscribers that
YouTubers like Zoe Sugg and JJ Olatunji/KSI attract, and in the amount of web traffic that
the websites of online newspapers and magazines generate.
Through an in-depth study of two contrasting online products, learners will look at the role
played by social media channels and websites in the media today, exploring the way in
which these convergent media platforms increasingly overlap, as well as investigating the
potential that they offer for self-representation. The changing relationship between media
producers and audiences will be considered here, as learners will examine the idea that
media consumers have now become producers who regularly and actively participate in the
creation and dissemination of media content online.
The impact of digitally convergent media platforms on media production, distribution and
circulation will also be explored, as learners will study an online magazine produced for a
minority group, considering the way in which digital platforms can be used to reach
specialised audiences. These set products can be seen to demonstrate significant emerging
developments in the media, reflecting the ongoing impact of technology on media language
and audience interaction.
Set Options for Media in the Online Age
One product from each group (two in total) must be chosen for study:

The set products will be reviewed periodically and changed where necessary.
Websites, blogs/vlogs, and social media channels are, by their very nature, dynamic and
updated to respond to industry and audience needs. Learners are required to study the
following elements of their chosen online products:
• the codes and conventions of the home page/YouTube channel, including aspects of
layout and design
• examples of posts, such as specific blogs, vlogs or articles from the online products
• examples of interactivity, including links to and use of social and participatory media.
Some features within the set products carry advisory guidance for strong language and
reference to some topics that some learners might find upsetting. It is the teacher's
responsibility to monitor the content of all set products and to ensure that the extracts
studied are appropriate for their learners.
For Section C, learners will develop their knowledge and understanding of the aspects of the

Assessment
This component assesses media language, representation, media industries, audiences and
media contexts.
Learners will be assessed on their use of relevant theories or theoretical approaches and
relevant subject-specific terminology in this component. Learners will also be required to
evaluate theoretical approaches and theories.
The exam consists of three sections:
Section A: Television in the Global Age (30 marks)
There will be one two-part question or one extended response question.
Section B – Magazines: Mainstream and Alternative Media (30 marks)
There will be one two-part question or one extended response question.
Section C – Media in the Online Age (30 marks)
There will be one two-part question or one extended response question.
Each part of a two-part question will be based on one set product. Extended response questions will
be based on both of the set products for that form.
Extended response questions require learners to construct and develop a sustained line of
reasoning which is coherent, relevant, substantiated and logically structured.

2.3 Component 3
Cross-Media Production
30% of qualification
60 marks
Non-exam assessment: internally assessed and externally moderated by WJEC
Content
This component synthesises knowledge and understanding of the media theoretical
framework gained throughout their course by requiring learners to apply their knowledge
and understanding of the media synoptically to practical production. In Components 1
and 2, learners gain a detailed understanding of the theoretical framework in relation to
a range of media forms. In this component, learners are required to apply their
knowledge and understanding of media language, representation, audiences, media
industries and the digitally convergent nature of the media in an individual production
for an intended audience. The production must be based on two media forms and
completed in response to a choice of briefs set by WJEC.
The set production briefs will change every year. The precise requirements of the set
briefs will differ each year and learners will be required to create a production for a
different intended audience and industry context. Learners must develop a
response to the specific requirements of the chosen brief by selecting a genre/style (or
topic/issue) appropriate to the specified intended audience and industry context
for their cross-media production.
The briefs will be released annually on 1 March in the year prior to assessment, and will
be published on the WJEC Eduqas secure website.
The following media forms will always be set:
Television
Create a cross-media production to include a sequence from a new television
programme and related print or online* products.
Advertising and Marketing: Music
Create a cross-media production to include an original music video for a new or
local/unsigned artist or band and related print or online* products.
Advertising and Marketing: Film
Create a cross-media production to include a print marketing campaign for a new film,
and related audio-visual or online* products.
The cross-media production must not include a complete short film, film sequence or
trailer.
Magazines
Create a cross-media production to include a new print magazine and related audio-
visual or online* products.
In order to ensure that an undue amount of time is not spent on the production, all
phases of the production – aims, research and planning and the production itself –
should be completed over a period of no longer than sixteen weeks.
*Website production
Learners are not required to create websites through programming languages such as
HTML. It is acceptable for learners to use web design software or templates in the
online options. However, learners must be responsible for the design of the website
and all content (such as language, images, audio-visual material) must be original.
Learners must acknowledge any software or templates, and details of how these have
been used, on the cover sheet.

A LEVEL MEDIA STUDIES 51
Statement of Aims and Intentions
Learners will be required to complete a brief outline of their aims and intentions for the cross-media
production that must be submitted with the production. This will be assessed with the cross-media
production and will enable learners to explain the ways in which they will apply knowledge and
understanding of the theoretical framework to the production and target the intended audience. This
is a compulsory component of the non-exam assessment and learners must complete the
statement of aims and intentions in Section B of the cover sheet using approximately 500 words.
A template is provided on the WJEC Eduqas website for guidance.
Research and Planning
Learners will undertake a substantial amount of preparatory work for their intended production that
must be guided, monitored and authenticated by the teacher. The cross- media production must be
conceptualised as a complete package of interrelated products in two forms, reflecting the nature of
the contemporary media and the importance of different platforms in distributing, and enabling
audiences to access, the media.
The research and planning will not be assessed but learners will be assessed on the production
outcomes that result from these stages.
Learners should undertake research to develop their understanding of the theoretical framework in
relation to their intended production including:
• Analysis of the use of media language in similar media products to identify the codes and
conventions of the particular genres and forms. Analysis should focus on:
o how specific techniques such as: layout and composition; editing; sound, etc. are used to
create meaning,
o the way in which representations of events, issues, individuals and social groups (as
appropriate) are constructed, considering how the choice and combination of elements of
media language influences meaning and conveys viewpoints and ideologies.
• Research into how the industry context – the media organisation, production processes,
distribution and marketing, scheduling/positioning, regulatory issues etc. – impacts on a
production. Research into the ways in which media industries use digital convergence across
different platforms – how media products are interrelated and how different media platforms can
be used to promote and distribute products, and engage audiences in different ways. Identify
examples from similar products analysed.
• Research into the methods used to target and address audiences, including analysis of the
techniques used to appeal to, engage and position an intended audience.
• Identify examples from similar products analysed. Research into audience responses to, and
interaction with, media products.
• Secondary research - academic theoretical research appropriate to A Level to develop
understanding and support analysis.
• Primary audience research such as focus groups research prior to completion of production
work.
Learners should also plan their production work carefully to ensure that they apply their
understanding of the theoretical framework to the cross-media production in different forms. The
planning work may include:
• A pitch or treatment for the cross-media production, considering the convergence of the
products in two forms and how they will be interrelated, but also distinct, to engage the intended
audience in different ways.
• A project plan including a timeline and the planned use of, for example, resources or
equipment.
• Planning documents appropriate to the form/product undertaken such as: a step outline; a shot
list; a storyboard; a script; draft designs; mock-ups of composition and layout.

Assessment
Component 3 is internally assessed and externally moderated. It assesses AO3: Create media
products for an intended audience, applying knowledge and understanding of the theoretical
framework of media to communicate meaning.
The total number of marks available is 60:
• 10 marks for the statement of aims and intentions
• 20 marks for creating a cross-media production that meets the requirements of the set
brief, including suitability for the chosen form, genre, industry context and audience
• 30 marks for creating a cross-media production which uses media language to
communicate meanings and construct representations.
The assessment of this component will be based on the statement of aims and intentions and
the cross-media production. Learners who do not submit a production will be awarded zero
marks for the statement of aims and intentions.
Teachers must use the assessment grid and guidance provided in Appendix A when
conducting internal assessment of Component 3.
Learners are advised to consider the requirements of the marking criteria (Appendix A) when
planning and creating their cross-media production. Learners will be assessed on their ability to
create a cross-media production for an intended audience and industry context by applying
their knowledge and understanding of the theoretical framework to the cross-media production
in the following ways:
• responding to the requirements of the brief, including using conventions appropriate to the
chosen form, genre and industry context and engaging the intended target audience
• completing all tasks detailed in the chosen set brief
• creating an appropriate cross-media production of products that are clearly interrelated
• using media language to communicate meanings
• using media language to construct representations of particular events/issues/groups and
individuals.
Assessment Evidence and Authentication
Every learner must complete a cover sheet to be found on the WJEC Eduqas website. This
form must be signed by both the teacher and the learner to authenticate the work undertaken.
Work should be reviewed for authentication purposes at four key stages of the process:
• when the planning stage is complete - review of the learner’s planning documents to verify
that the work has been completed by the learner
• at two suitable points during the production process, to monitor both tasks within the
cross-media production. This might include a review of, for example, footage that has
been shot for an audio-visual task and a full draft of a print or online task including the main
images/ written text, to check that this is the learner’s independent work
• when the cross-media production is complete – review of the finished production.
At each authenticating stage, teachers must sign and date the appropriate section of the
cover sheet. It is important that the completion of the production is rigorously monitored by
centres to ensure that learners' work is their own. Teachers must sign the completed cover
sheet to validate the authenticity of learners' work.

A LEVEL MEDIA STUDIES 53
Learners must submit:
• A cross-media production.
• A statement of aims and intentions for the production, outlining the ways in which
knowledge and understanding of the theoretical framework will be applied in response to
the brief and how the intended audience will be targeted.
• A completed cover sheet available on the WJEC Eduqas website. Section A must be
completed by the learner detailing key aspects of the work, including the software used in
its construction and crediting any non-original music used and non-assessed participants
who assisted with the cross-media production. Learners and teachers must sign to
authenticate the work at four key stages as detailed above. Section C is to be completed by
the teacher detailing their assessment comments and the marks awarded.
Research and planning work should not be submitted but learners and teachers are required to
authenticate the process on the cover sheet. Centres must retain all learners’ research and
planning work, and all learners' production work, until December of the calendar year in
which the assessment has been taken, and make this work available to WJEC should
this be requested.
Original and Non-original material
Learners are required to create original material for this component. Candidates who do not use
original footage, images or text in the production must not be awarded marks above band 1 for
the production. The use of existing brands or products is not permitted and the images, footage
and text used in the cross-media production must be original (i.e. created by the learner).
It is acceptable for learners to use an existing song by a band or artist for the music video
production option, provided the track chosen for the music video does not have an existing
video. It is also acceptable for learners to use existing music for sound-tracks (e.g. for an
audio-visual sequence). In this case, music must be copyright-free. All other aspects of the
cross-media production must be the candidate's own, original work.
Any non-original music used as a soundtrack or in a music video must be acknowledged on the
cover sheet (available on the WJEC's Eduqas website).

A LEVEL MEDIA STUDIES 54
Independent Work
The learner must complete an individual cross-media production. However, the learner may use
unassessed students and others as follows:
• To appear in their media products, as actors or models for example.
• To operate equipment, such as lighting or sound recording equipment, under the direction
of the assessed learner.
All non-assessed individuals involved in the production must be credited on the cover sheet.
Learners can be credited only for work completed by themselves, or under their direction, and
teachers will be required to sign to state that this is the case.
Equipment/Software
Learners need to have access to suitable equipment and resources for production work in
Component 3 in order to apply media language appropriately (including the appropriate codes
and conventions of media forms, genres and/or styles) to the products they create for
Component 3.
As noted on page 47, learners are not required to create websites through programming
languages such as HTML. It is acceptable for learners to use web design software or
templates in the online options. However, learners must be responsible for the design of the
website and all content (such as language, images, audio-visual material) must be original.
The software packages used in the creation of the cross-media production must be listed on the
cover sheet with a brief explanation of how they have been used. The assessor will take this
information into account when marking each production. Where there has been over reliance
on pre-existing templates, this will result in a lower mark being awarded, as detailed in the mark
scheme.
Re-sitting the qualification: non-examination assessment
As noted in Section 4 below, learners may re-sit the qualification. Components 1 and 2 must
be re-taken whereas marks for Component 3 may be carried forward. Should a learner choose
to re-take Component 3, they must follow the brief set for the relevant year and be subject to all
the authenticating conditions of the production.
