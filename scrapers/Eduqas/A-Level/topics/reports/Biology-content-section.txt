2. Genetic information is copied and passed on to daughter cells
Overview
This topic covers cell division. During the cell cycle, genetic information is copied and
passed on to daughter cells.
Working scientifically
The specified practical work in this topic gives learners opportunities to use the light
microscope and to produce annotated scientific drawings from observation. There is
also the opportunity for learners to produce their own slide of dividing cells in a root
tip.
Mathematical Skills
There are a number of opportunities for the development of mathematical skills
especially within the microscope work in this topic. These include making use of
appropriate units; using ratios, fractions and percentages; using an appropriate
number of significant figures and decimal places; making order of magnitude
calculations; changing the subject of an equation; substitution of numerical values
into algebraic equations.
How Science Works
The understanding of cell division within this topic for learners to develop the ability
to: use theories, models and ideas to develop scientific explanations; communicate
information and ideas in appropriate ways using appropriate terminology. The
significance of unrestricted division leading to cancerous growth could lead to the
consideration of applications and implications of science and evaluating their
associated benefits and risks.
Learners should be able to demonstrate and apply their knowledge and
understanding of:
(a) interphase and the main stages of mitosis
(b) the significance of mitosis as a process in which daughter cells are provided
with identical copies of genes and the process of cytokinesis
(c) the significance of mitosis in terms of damage and disease: repeated cell
renewal, damage repair and healing and unrestricted division leading to
cancerous growth
(d) the main stages of meiosis (names of subdivisions of prophase 1 not
required) and cytokinesis
(e) the differences between mitosis and meiosis, including that mitosis produces
genetically identical daughter cells whereas meiosis produces non-identical
daughter cells

3. Sexual reproduction in humans
Overview
Sexual reproduction is the production of offspring with a new combination of alleles
resulting from the fusion of male and female gametes.
Working scientifically
There are opportunities in this topic to develop microscope skills in the observation of
the histology of ovary and testis.
Mathematical Skills
There are a number of opportunities for the development of mathematical skills
especially within the endocrine control section in this topic. These include:
construction and interpretation of tables and diagrams; calculation of magnification;
translating information between graphical, numerical and algebraic forms;
determining the intercept of a graph.
How Science Works
The understanding of the hormonal control of female reproduction allows learners to
communicate information and ideas in appropriate ways using appropriate
terminology.
Learners should be able to demonstrate and apply their knowledge and
understanding of:
(a) the structure and function of the reproductive systems in humans, including
the examination of histology of ovary and testis
(b) the processes of spermatogenesis and oogenesis to produce spermatozoa
and secondary oocytes; sexual intercourse; fertilisation and implantation
(c) the endocrine control of reproduction in the female: including the menstrual
cycle, birth and lactation by reference to follicle stimulating hormone,
luteinising hormone, oestrogen, progesterone, oxytocin and prolactin and
human chorionic gonadotrophin
(d) the role of the placenta including hormonal control

4. Sexual reproduction in plants
Overview
This topic covers the process of reproduction in flowering plants.
Working scientifically
There are a number of opportunities in this topic to develop practical skills. These
include microscope skills in the observation of the histology of ovary and anther; the
use of appropriate apparatus in recording quantitative measurements in an
investigation into the digestion of starch agar; the safe use of instruments in the
dissection of the reproductive organs of flowers.
Mathematical Skills
There are a number of opportunities for the development of mathematical skills
especially within the practical section in this topic. These include within the
microscope work: making order of magnitude calculations; changing the subject of an
equation; substitution of numerical values into algebraic equations; making use of
appropriate units; using an appropriate number of significant figures and decimal
places. Within the investigation work: finding arithmetic means; calculating mean
median and mode; construction and interpretation of tables and diagrams; translating
information between graphical, numerical and algebraic forms; plotting two variables
from experimental or other data.
How Science Works
The understanding of the reproductive systems and processes in plants allow
opportunities to: use theories, models and ideas to develop scientific explanations.
The investigation of germinating seeds allows: the use of appropriate methodology,
including information and communication technology (ICT) to answer scientific
questions and solve scientific problems; experimental and investigative activities,
including appropriate risk assessments; analysis and interpretation of data to provide
evidence; evaluation of methodology, evidence and data, and resolving of conflicting
evidence.
Learners should be able to demonstrate and apply their knowledge and
understanding of:

pollinated flowers

5. Inheritance
Overview
This topic covers genetics. Genetics is the study of the inheritance of characteristics.
The effect of epigenetics affecting the expression of these characteristics is also
included.
Working scientifically
This topic gives learners opportunities to develop skills in the use of ICT such as
computer modelling in studying gene segregation.

There are a number of opportunities for the development of mathematical skills
especially within the use of the chi squared test in this topic. These include: using
ratios, fractions and percentages; using significant figures; understanding simple
probability; selecting and using a statistical test.
How Science Works
The principles of inheritance allow learners to develop the ability to: use theories,
models and ideas to develop scientific explanations; use knowledge and
understanding to pose scientific questions, define scientific problems, present
scientific arguments and scientific ideas. Investigating gene segregation develops:
the use of appropriate methodology to answer scientific questions and solve scientific
problems; experimental and investigative activities, including appropriate risk
assessments; analysis and interpretation of data to provide evidence, recognising
correlations; evaluation of methodology, evidence and data, and resolve conflicting
evidence. The understanding of epigenetics allows learners to: know that scientific
knowledge and understanding develops over time. The study of genetic disorders
allows the consideration of the applications and implications of science and
evaluation of their associated benefits and risks; consideration of ethical issues in the
treatment of humans, other organisms and the environment; evaluation of the role of
the scientific community in validating new knowledge and ensuring integrity.
