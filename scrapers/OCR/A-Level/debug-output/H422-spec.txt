About our new name
i
As of September 2025, our name is Cambridge OCR.
Students who sat an exam in summer 2025 will receive a Cambridge OCR branded exam certificate
(our new brand), which will be the same for all future exam series.
You’ll continue to see the OCR or Oxford Cambridge and RSA Examinations name while we work
to update our material to our new name, Cambridge OCR. This will take some time, and you can still
access all up-to-date qualification resources and materials via Teach Cambridge.
Important: We’ll keep the OCR/Oxford Cambridge and RSA name on existing teaching resources
while the content of these remains applicable to the specification being taught. New and refreshed
resources will be produced using the Cambridge OCR name/logo.
Are you using the latest version of this specification?
The latest version of our specifications will always be on our website and may differ from printed versions.
We will inform centres about changes to specifications.

Your feedback plays an important role in how we develop, market, support and resource qualifications now and
into the future. We want you and your students to enjoy and get the best out of our qualifications and resources,
but to do that we need your honest opinions to tell us whether we’re on the right track or not.

Table 2 Common Practical Assessment Criteria (CPAC) for the assessment of practical competency in A Level
sciences
Competency Practical Mastery
In order to be awarded a Pass a Learner must, by the end of the practical science
assessment, consistently and routinely meet the criteria in respect of each
competency listed below. A Learner may demonstrate the competencies in any
practical activity undertaken as part of that assessment throughout the course of
study.
Learners may undertake practical activities in groups. However, the evidence
generated by each Learner must demonstrate that he or she independently meets
the criteria outlined below in respect of each competency. Such evidence –
a) will comprise both the Learner’s performance during each practical activity and
his or her contemporaneous record of the work that he or she has undertaken
during that activity, and
b) must include evidence of independent application of investigative approaches
and methods to practical work.
(1) Follows written a) Correctly follows instructions to carry out experimental techniques or
procedures procedures.

d) Selects appropriate equipment and measurement strategies in order to ensure

(3) Safely uses a range of a) Identifies hazards and assesses risks associated with these hazards, making
practical equipment and safety adjustments as necessary, when carrying out experimental techniques and
materials procedures in the lab or field.
b) Uses appropriate safety equipment and approaches to minimise risks with

(4) Makes and records a) Makes accurate observations relevant to the experimental or investigative
observations procedure.
b) Obtains accurate, precise and sufficient data for experimental and investigative
procedures and records this methodically using appropriate units and conventions.
(5) Researches, a) Uses appropriate software and/or tools to process data, carry out research and
references and reports report findings.
b) Cites sources of information, demonstrating that research has taken place,
supporting planning and conclusions.
