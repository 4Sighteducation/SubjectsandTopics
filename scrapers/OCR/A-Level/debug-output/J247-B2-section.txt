Topic B2: Scaling up
B2.1 Supplying the cell
Summary Common misconceptions
Cells transport many substances across their membranes by diffusion, osmosis Learners commonly show some confusion regarding surface area: volume ratio,
and active transport. Stem cells are found in both plants and animals. These particularly how larger animals have a smaller surface area: volume ratio. They
stem cells can divide, differentiate and become specialised to form tissues, also show some confusion as to stem cells: where they are found and their roles.

B2.2 The challenges of size
Summary Common misconceptions
When organisms become multicellular, the need arises for highly adapted Learners have a view that the slow flow of blood in capillaries is due to the

importance of the slow flow of blood in allowing time for exchange by diffusion,
Underlying knowledge and understanding this misunderstanding should be considered.
Learners should be familiar with the role of diffusion in the movement of
materials in and between cells. They should also be familiar with the human Tiering
gaseous exchange system. Statements shown in bold type will only be tested in the Higher Tier papers.
All other statements will be assessed in both Foundation and Higher Tier papers.
