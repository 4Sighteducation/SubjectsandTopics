Elements from the sea (ES)
The presence of halide salts in the sea provides the Finally, atom economy is introduced through the

The use of chlorine in bleach is used to introduce
the concept of equilibrium and calculations of the • halogen chemistry
equilibrium constant, as well as iodine–thiosulfate

titrations. This leads into a discussion of the risks and
benefits of using chlorine. • equilibrium
• atom economy.
