1.2.2.1.4 Content 2.1.4: Apply techniques in order to communicate and record design ideas suitable to the stage of development in order to justify their own thinking and present their thinking and intentions to a third party, such as:
1.2.2.1.4.1 Content 2.1.4.1: informal 2D and 3D sketching and modelling to communicate initial ideas
1.2.2.1.4.2 Content 2.1.4.2: system and schematic diagrams, annotated sketches, exploded diagrams, models and written notes, to communicate development iterations
1.2.2.1.4.3 Content 2.1.4.3: audio and visual recordings to share thinking, explorations and the functionality of ideas
1.2.2.1.4.4 Content 2.1.4.4: formal 2D and 3D working drawings to outline specification requirements; 3D illustrations, mathematical modelling and computer-based tools to present final design solutions; schedules and flow charts to deliver planning
1.2.2.1.4.5 Content 2.1.4.5: presentations and real-time evidence to communicate throughout the project.
1.2.2.2 Topic 2.2: Material considerations
1.2.2.2.1 Content 2.2.1: Develop and apply in-depth knowledge by selecting and working with appropriate materials and components when developing their ideas, early models and producing their final prototype(s).
1.2.2.3 Topic 2.3: Technical understanding
1.2.2.3.1 Content 2.3.1: Apply technical principles appropriately to ensure functional requirements are achieved when developing a design solution.
1.2.2.3.2 Content 2.3.2: Be able to use surface treatments and finishes for functional and aesthetic purposes.
1.2.2.4 Topic 2.4: Manufacturing processes and techniques
1.2.2.4.1 Content 2.4.1: Be able to use specialist techniques and processes to shape, fabricate, construct and assemble at least one high quality prototype, including techniques such as wastage, addition, deforming and reforming, as appropriate to the materials and/or system components being used.
1.2.2.4.2 Content 2.4.2: Be able to use specialist tools and equipment, appropriate to the materials or system components used (including hand tools, machinery, digital design and manufacture), to create models and prototypes.
1.2.2.4.3 Content 2.4.3: Be able to use appropriate and accurate marking out methods including: measuring and use of reference points, lines and surfaces; use templates, jigs and/or patterns where appropriate; work within tolerances; understand efficient cutting and how to minimise waste.
1.2.3 Section 3: Evaluate (AO3)
1.2.3.1 Topic 3.1: Viability of design solutions
1.2.3.1.1 Content 3.1.1: Be able to test, critically analyse and evaluate their design solutions against the identified stakeholder requirements, design opportunities and constraints in order to refine and improve future iterations.
1.2.3.1.2 Content 3.1.2: Be able to make informed and reasoned decisions throughout the iterative design process, responding to feedback as appropriate to identify the potential next steps of further development.
1.2.3.1.3 Content 3.1.3: Be able to respond to feedback given by others about their prototype(s) in order to identify the potential for further development and suggest how modifications could be made through design optimisation.
