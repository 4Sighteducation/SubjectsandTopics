About our new name
i
As of September 2025, our name is Cambridge OCR.
Students who sat an exam in summer 2025 will receive a Cambridge OCR branded exam certificate
(our new brand), which will be the same for all future exam series.
You’ll continue to see the OCR or Oxford Cambridge and RSA Examinations name while we work
to update our material to our new name, Cambridge OCR. This will take some time, and you can still
access all up-to-date qualification resources and materials via Teach Cambridge.
Important: We’ll keep the OCR/Oxford Cambridge and RSA name on existing teaching resources
while the content of these remains applicable to the specification being taught. New and refreshed
resources will be produced using the Cambridge OCR name/logo.
Are you using the latest version of this specification?
The latest version of our specifications will always be on our website and may differ from printed versions.
We will inform centres about changes to specifications.
Tell us what you think
Your feedback plays an important role in how we develop, market, support and resource qualifications now and
into the future. We want you and your students to enjoy and get the best out of our qualifications and resources,
but to do that we need your honest opinions to tell us whether we’re on the right track or not.
You can email your thoughts to support@ocr.org.uk or visit our feedback page to learn more about how you can

planning. Spontaneous improvisation refers to making up a role as you go along.
Prepared/planned improvisation refers to working and reworking within a
structure of ideas and roles agreed in advance.
ROLE PLAY Pretending to be someone (or something) else. Role play is generally confined
to taking on a clearly defined role such as a doctor, a bus driver or teacher
without any attempt at in-depth psychological analysis or understanding. What
distinguishes it from acting is that role play is not intended for performance to
an audience.
ROLE REVERSAL/ROLE When, during an improvisation or rehearsal for a scene, the actors swap the
TRANSFER roles/characters they are portraying to gain a different view or understanding of
their own role.
ROLE-ON-THE-WALL A life-sized outline of a figure is drawn on the wall to represent a character or
role being developed or explored. Members of the group take it in turns to write
facts and information about the character/role within the outline. Physical
details might all be written in the head area, for example, whereas things the
character likes might be written in the right leg. Opinions and views from other
people or characters can be added around the outside of the figure.

STILL IMAGE Creating a picture to represent a frozen moment or to sum up what is happening
in a drama. It is a useful technique for exploring the effects of positioning
characters in relation to one another in terms of levels and proximity and to
demonstrate non-verbal communication. It is often used with sculpting and
1
thoughts in the head. (See also TABLEAU)
STIMULUS An artefact used as a starting point for devising original drama and theatre
performances.
STORYBOARDING A series of images and/or text showing the sequence of the action planned for
a play.
TABLEAU(X) A dramatic grouping of characters. A tableau may not necessarily be a still or
frozen image. It can be a general ‘stage picture’ during a sequence in a scene
where dialogue may be spoken and gestures used. In tableau vivant, the
performers are positioned to represent a picture or ‘fresco’, and props and
costumes are often used as an integral part of the stage picture. Tableau can
4
also be used to describe a pause on stage where all performers briefly freeze
in position. This can typically be found at the end of scenes in Victorian
melodramas. (See also STILL IMAGE)
5
TEACHER-IN-ROLE When a class or group of participants in a drama accepts that the teacher
(or leader) is going to play a role to which they are going to react and respond.
The participants may or may not be in role.
TECHNIQUE Used here to refer to drama forms, exercises, strategies and conventions that are
widely used to develop understanding and explore meaning through the drama
process. In a broader context, techniques encompass the whole range of physical
and psychological processes and exercises that an actor might use to develop
their skills as a performer.
THOUGHT TRACKING An exercise that allows the inner thoughts of a character or role to be heard out
loud. It is often used with freeze frame or still image, where a participant is
asked to say what they are thinking at that point in time.
WRITING IN ROLE An exercise where, for example, a letter, a diary or journal is written as if by the
character or role being portrayed. It is a useful technique for work on building
character.
Process
CALL A notification of a working session (e.g. a Rehearsal Call, Band Call, Photo Call).
CUE 1) The command given to technical departments to carry out a particular
operation
2) Any signal (spoken line, action or count) that indicates another action should
follow.

Version 3.0 © Cambridge OCR 2025
Cambridge OCR Level 3 Advanced GCE in Drama and Theatre 85
FORM The shape and structure of a drama. In theatre, form is determined by the
content of the drama (e.g. the way the playwright has constructed the narrative
elements) and by the way it is presented (the choices made by actors, designers
and directors in interpreting the material for performance). Form is closely
associated with genre and these terms are often confused but they do not have
the same meaning. For example, a play classified as in a naturalistic genre will be
recognised by the audience as naturalistic by the form it takes on stage. (See also
GENRE and STYLE)
HISTORICAL CONTEXT The time the text was written and the playwright was writing, and context within
the text of when and where the narrative is set.
PRESENT-DAY A performance for an audience today. See also CONTEMPORARY.

their relationships and feelings.
REALISATION The performance that is viewed by an audience.
REPERTOIRE A collection of regularly performed pieces or techniques, usually attributed to a
particular performer or playwright.
5 SEMIOTICS How meaning is created and communicated through systems of signs and
symbols of drama. All of the elements that make up a theatrical performance
have meaning and an audience ‘reads’ or interprets them to understand the
events in the performance.
SOCIAL CONTEXT The relationships and interactions between the characters and the events in the
text.
SUSPENSION OF The idea that an audience watching a drama is willing to accept that what is
DISBELIEF happening on stage (or on film) is real.
VISION The description or record of the artistic intention for the performance. See also
ARTISTIC INTENTION.
