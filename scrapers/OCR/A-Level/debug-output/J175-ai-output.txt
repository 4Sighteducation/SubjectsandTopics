1. Three-Dimensional Design (J175)
   1.1. Overview
      1.1.1. Three-Dimensional Design is defined as the design, prototyping and modelling or making of primarily functional and aesthetic consumer products, objects and environments.
      1.1.2. Learners must explore, acquire and develop skills, knowledge and understanding through the application of techniques and processes specific to their chosen area(s) of study of Three-Dimensional Design.
      1.1.3. Learners must explore practical and relevant critical and contextual sources such as the work of historical and contemporary three-dimensional designers and the different purposes, intentions and functions of three-dimensional design as appropriate to their own work.
      1.1.4. Learners must demonstrate the knowledge, skills and understanding through area(s) of study relevant to Three-Dimensional Design.
   1.2. Areas of Study
      1.2.1. Learners are required to work in one or more area(s) of Three-Dimensional Design, such as those listed below. Combinations of these areas are also possible.
         1.2.1.1. Architectural design
         1.2.1.2. Interior design
         1.2.1.3. Product design
         1.2.1.4. Exhibition design
         1.2.1.5. Environmental/landscape design
         1.2.1.6. Sculpture
         1.2.1.7. Design for theatre, film and television
         1.2.1.8. Jewellery and body adornment
         1.2.1.9. Ceramics
         1.2.1.10. Design communications
   1.3. Techniques
      1.3.1. Learners must demonstrate the ability to work creatively with processes and techniques appropriate to the chosen area(s) of study such as: computer-aided design, model-making, prototyping, constructing, assembling. An understanding of the relationship between form and function is essential.
   1.4. Skills
      1.4.1. Learners are required to demonstrate the knowledge, skills and understanding as defined in the Art and Design Core Content section of this specification in the context of their chosen area(s) of Three-Dimensional Design.
      1.4.2. In addition, learners will be required to demonstrate skills in the following:
         1.4.2.1. Develop ideas through investigations informed by selecting and critically analysing sources.
         1.4.2.2. Apply an understanding of relevant Three-Dimensional Design practices in the creative and cultural industries to their work.
         1.4.2.3. Refine their ideas as work progresses through researching, selecting, analysing, constructing and presenting artefact(s)/product(s)/personal outcome(s).
         1.4.2.4. Record their ideas, observations, insights and independent judgements, in ways that are appropriate to the Three-Dimensional Design title, such as cutting and constructing material in three-dimensions.
         1.4.2.5. Use appropriate specialist vocabulary through either visual communication or written annotation, or both, within three-dimensional design.
         1.4.2.6. Use visual language critically as appropriate to their own creative intentions and chosen area(s) of Three-Dimensional Design through effective and safe use of:
            1.4.2.6.1. Media
            1.4.2.6.2. Materials
            1.4.2.6.3. Techniques
            1.4.2.6.4. Processes
            1.4.2.6.5. Technologies
         1.4.2.7. Use drawing skills for different needs and purposes, appropriate to the area(s) of study used. Drawing may take the form of maquette, scale model(s) and computer-aided design using appropriate media and materials.
         1.4.2.8. Realise personal intentions in Three-Dimensional Design, through the sustained application of the three-dimensional design process.
   1.5. Knowledge and Understanding
      1.5.1. Learners are required to demonstrate the knowledge and understanding listed below through practical application of skills to realise personal intentions relevant to their chosen area(s) of Three-Dimensional Design.
      1.5.2. Learners are required to know and understand how sources inspire the development of their ideas.
      1.5.3. Reference should be made to the following:
         1.5.3.1. The work and approaches of three-dimensional designers from contemporary and/or historical contexts, periods, societies and cultures.
         1.5.3.2. Contemporary and/or historical environments, situations or issues.
         1.5.3.3. Other relevant sources researched by the learner in their chosen area(s) of three-dimensional design.
         1.5.3.4. The ways in which meanings, ideas and intentions can be communicated through visual and tactile language, using formal elements, including:
            1.5.3.4.1. Colour
            1.5.3.4.2. Line
            1.5.3.4.3. Form
            1.5.3.4.4. Tone
            1.5.3.4.5. Texture
         1.5.3.5. The characteristics, properties and effects of using different media, materials, techniques and processes, and the ways in which they can be used in relation to learners’ own creative intentions and chosen area(s) of Three-Dimensional Design.
         1.5.3.6. The different purposes, intentions and functions of three-dimensional design in a variety of contexts and as appropriate to learners’ own work.
