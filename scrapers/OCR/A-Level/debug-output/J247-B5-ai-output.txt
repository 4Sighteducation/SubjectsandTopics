1.1 B5.1 Inheritance
1.1.1 B5.1a explain the following terms: gamete, chromosome, gene, allele/variant, dominant, recessive, homozygous, heterozygous, genotype and phenotype
1.1.1.1 Use of alleles to work out the phenotype of progeny
1.1.2 B5.1b describe the genome as the entire genetic material of an organism
1.1.3 B5.1c describe that the genome, and its interaction with the environment, influence the development of the phenotype of an organism
1.1.3.1 use of examples of discontinuous (e.g. eye colour) and continuous variation (e.g. weight and height)
1.1.4 B5.1d Recall that all variants arise from mutations, and that most have no effect on the phenotype, some influence phenotype and a very few determine phenotype
1.1.5 B5.1e describe how genetic variants may influence phenotype
1.1.5.1 in coding DNA by altering the activity of a protein
1.1.5.2 in non-coding DNA by altering how genes are expressed
1.1.5.3 affecting protein structure, including active sites of enzymes
1.1.5.4 stopping transcription of mRNA
1.1.6 B5.1f explain some of the advantages and disadvantages of asexual and sexual reproduction in a range of organisms
1.1.6.1 the number of live offspring per birth
1.1.6.2 how quickly the organisms can reproduce
1.1.6.3 the need for the introduction of variation in a population caused by environmental pressures
1.1.7 B5.1g explain the terms haploid and diploid
1.1.8 B5.1h explain the role of meiotic cell division in halving the chromosome number to form gametes
1.1.8.1 that this maintains diploid cells when gametes combine
1.1.8.2 is a source of genetic variation
1.1.9 B5.1i explain single gene inheritance
1.1.9.1 the context of homozygous and heterozygous crosses involving dominant and recessive genes
1.1.10 B5.1j predict the results of single gene crosses
1.1.10.1 the use of Punnett squares
1.1.11 B5.1k describe sex determination in humans using a genetic cross
1.1.11.1 the use of Punnett squares
1.1.12 B5.1l recall that most phenotypic features are the result of multiple genes rather than single gene inheritance
1.1.13 B5.1m describe the development of our understanding of genetics
1.1.13.1 the work of Mendel

2.1 B5.2 Natural selection and evolution
2.1.1 B5.2a state that there is usually extensive genetic variation within a population of a species
2.1.2 B5.2b describe the impact of developments in biology on classification systems
2.1.2.1 natural and artificial classification systems
2.1.2.2 use of molecular phylogenetics based on DNA sequencing
2.1.3 B5.2c explain how evolution occurs through the natural selection of variants that have given rise to phenotypes best suited to their environment
2.1.3.1 the concept of mutation
2.1.4 B5.2d describe evolution as a change in the inherited characteristics of a population over time, through a process of natural selection, which may result in the formation of new species
2.1.5 B5.2e describe the evidence for evolution
2.1.5.1 fossils
2.1.5.2 antibiotic resistance in bacteria
2.1.6 B5.2f describe the work of Darwin and Wallace in the development of the theory of evolution by natural selection and explain the impact of these ideas on modern biology
2.1.6.1 seedbanks being used as a store of biodiversity
