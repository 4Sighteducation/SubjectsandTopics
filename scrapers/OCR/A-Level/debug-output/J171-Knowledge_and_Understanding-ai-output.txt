1 Overview
1.1 Fine Art is defined here as the practice of creating work that is primarily for aesthetic, intellectual or purely conceptual purposes, rather than purposes that have a necessarily practical function.
1.2 Learners must explore, acquire and develop skills, knowledge and understanding through the application of techniques and processes specific to their chosen area(s) of study of Fine Art.
1.3 Learners must explore practical and relevant critical and contextual sources such as the work of historical and contemporary fine artists and the different purposes, intentions and functions of fine art as appropriate to their own work.
1.4 Learners must demonstrate the knowledge, skills and understanding through area(s) of study relevant to Fine Art.

2 Areas of Study
2.1 Drawing
2.2 Installation
2.3 Lens-/Light-based Media
2.4 Mixed-media
2.5 Land art
2.6 Printing
2.7 Painting
2.8 Sculpture

3 Techniques
3.1 Learners must demonstrate the ability to work creatively with processes and techniques appropriate to the chosen area(s) of study such as: painting (various media), drawing (various media), printing (e.g. screen printing, etching, aquatint, lithography, block printing), stencils, carving, modelling, constructing, mosaic, mobiles, environmental art, graffito, kinetic media, light based media, digital media, mixed-media.

4 Skills
4.1 Develop their ideas through investigations informed by selecting and critically analysing sources
4.2 Apply an understanding of relevant fine art practices in the creative and cultural industries to their work
4.3 Refine their ideas as work progresses through recording, selecting, editing and presenting fine art artefact(s)/product(s)/personal outcome(s)
4.4 Record their ideas, observations, insights and independent judgements, in ways that are appropriate to the Fine Art title such as, drawing or photographing
4.5 Use appropriate specialist vocabulary through either visual communication or written annotation, or both, within Fine Art
4.6 Use visual language critically as appropriate to their own creative intentions and chosen area(s) of study through effective and safe use of:
4.6.1 media
4.6.2 materials
4.6.3 techniques
4.6.4 processes
4.6.5 technologies
4.7 Use drawing skills for different needs and purposes, appropriate to the area(s) of study used. Drawing may take the form of mark-making, sketching or linear representations using appropriate media and materials
4.8 Realise personal intentions in Fine Art, through the sustained application of the fine art process.

5 Knowledge and Understanding
5.1 Learners are required to demonstrate the knowledge and understanding listed below through practical application of skills to realise personal intentions relevant to their chosen area(s) of Fine Art.
5.2 Learners are required to know and understand how sources inspire the development of their ideas.
5.3 Reference should be made to the following:
5.3.1 The work and approaches of fine artists from contemporary and/or historical contexts, periods, societies and cultures
5.3.2 Contemporary and/or historical environments, situations or issues
5.3.3 Other relevant sources researched by the learner in their chosen area(s) of fine art

5.3.4.1 colour
5.3.4.2 line
5.3.4.3 form
5.3.4.4 tone
5.3.4.5 texture
5.3.5 The characteristics, properties and effects of using different media, materials, techniques and processes, and the ways in which they can be used in relation to learners’ own creative intentions and chosen area(s) of Fine Art
5.3.6 The different purposes, intentions and functions of Fine Art in a variety of contexts and as appropriate to learners’ own work.
