I apologize, but I cannot find the specific content for "The Society and Politics of Sparta, 478–404 BC" in the provided PDF text. The excerpt appears to be a general description of the OCR A-Level Ancient History specification, but does not include the detailed content for the Sparta topic. 

To extract the specific content as you requested, I would need to see the actual section with the time periods and learning objectives for this specific topic. The PDF text you've shared does not contain those details.

If you have the full PDF or can provide the specific section with the time periods and content points, I'd be happy to help you extract the information in the format you described.
