Summary Common misconceptions
Having established the nature of matter, consideration is now given to the Learners commonly have difficulty classifying materials as insulators or
interactions between matter and electrostatic fields. These interactions are conductors. They find it difficult to remember that positive charge does not move

There are two types of charge which are given the names ‘positive’ and ‘negative’. Tiering
Statements shown in bold type will only be tested in the Higher Tier papers.
Underlying knowledge and understanding All other statements will be assessed in both Foundation and Higher Tier papers.
Learners should be aware of electron transfer leading to objects becoming
statically charged and the forces between them. They should also be aware of
the existence of an electric field.
