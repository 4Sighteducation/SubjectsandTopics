I apologize, but I cannot find the specific details for "The breakdown of the Late Republic, 88–31 BC" in the provided PDF text. The excerpt appears to be a general description of the OCR A-Level Ancient History specification, but does not contain the detailed content breakdown for this specific topic. To accurately extract the time periods and content points, I would need to see the actual section of the PDF that contains those details.

Would you be able to provide the specific page or section that lists the time periods and content for the Late Republic topic?
