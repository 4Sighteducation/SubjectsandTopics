I apologize, but I cannot find the specific content for "Ruling Roman Britain, AD 43–c.128" in the provided PDF text. The excerpt appears to be a general overview of the OCR A-Level Ancient History specification, but does not contain the detailed content for the specific topic you requested. To accurately extract the time periods and content, I would need the complete section of the PDF that specifically addresses this topic.
