2c. Core Content of A Level in Art and Design
The following core content outlines the scope, context, specialisms within the suite of qualifications. This
approaches, skills and knowledge and understanding needs to be used in conjunction with the content
which underpin all the endorsed Art and Design provided for each specialism.
Scope and Context • Learners must engage in integrated critical, practical and theoretical study
2 in Art and Design.
• Learners must demonstrate an ability to work within relevant frameworks
and use a broad range of media. They must develop independence
in relation to exploring their own ideas and lines of enquiry, refining
intentions and producing personal outcomes.
• Understanding context is a significant element in the process of building
knowledge of the subject. It provides the relevant platform to help explore
and understand ideas, feelings and meanings.
• Learners should demonstrate an understanding of the context through
critical evaluation in relation to research, written analysis and practical
work. Contextual referencing should be evidenced through evaluation of
historical and contemporary practitioners, creative industries, societies
and cultures, popular culture, historical and current events.
• Learners’ critical and contextual understanding will be evidenced
throughout all processes and outcomes. The form of critical and contextual
understanding may be directed by the approach to media used in the
specialism(s) taken but not exclusively so.
• Learners must demonstrate, where applicable, an awareness of different
roles, functions, audiences and consumers of art, craft and design.
• The related study element must extend learners’ understanding and
knowledge of context. Learners are required to establish, through this
written and illustrated element, the overarching principles of their
specialist area. This may be established by exploring art theory, genre,
subject matter, movement or historical framework.
• Through the course of study, learners must understand the importance
of the on-going development and refining process. The production of
outcome(s) in the context of developing their skills and knowledge, as well
as an awareness of the links between practical and written material, is
necessary.
• Learners are required to identify and acknowledge all sources consulted
during their research which should be in the form of a bibliography of
books, journals and websites.
Approaches • Learners should be made aware of the broad range of media and
approaches in which they can operate.
• Learners may work in traditional media, digital media and emerging
technologies or a combination within any specialism.
Version 1.7 © OCR 2024
8 A Level in Art and Design
• Critical and contextual understanding should be embedded throughout the
course of study through all investigative processes, research and practical
work. Learners should reflect critically and extract meaning from art,
craft and design and use this to place their own work in a framework of
advanced study. Approaches to critical and contextual understanding can
be modified, either as a link and support to practical work, or research into
the overarching context of art, craft and design.
• Learners may use a range of approaches to demonstrate progression of
ideas relevant to their chosen specialism: these may include sketchbooks, 2
workbooks, journals, digital and audio presentations and associated
software.
• Learners may take an applied approach to any specialism, working to a
brief and framework whilst developing an awareness of the approaches
and activities that relate to the creative industries. An applied approach
should reflect the current working practices, constraints, functions,
audiences, consumers and clients within the professional art and design
sector.
• Drawing in the context of art and design is a core element of the practice
of artists, crafts people and designers. The purpose of drawing is
recording, communicating and visualising intentions, ideas and emotions.
Furthermore, drawing may communicate emerging possibilities and
potential lines of enquiry. There is a need for all learners to develop
understanding and skills in forms of drawing that are appropriate to their
chosen specialism(s) and the context in which the drawing is undertaken.
• Drawing may take different forms. For example, it could be shown through
the art of mark making as a way of recording the observed world. Other
ways of drawing may include stitch and collage, storyboarding, and two-
and three-dimensional designs and may be approached through traditional
media or digital media and emerging technologies, or a combination
of both. Mounted sheets, sketchbooks, illustrated journals and digital
presentations are commonly used as an effective way of demonstrating
drawing skills and the impact made on the creative directions chosen.
Core Skills Learners are required to develop the skills to:
• record experiences and observations, in a variety of ways using drawing or
other appropriate visual forms; undertake research and gather, select and
organise visual and other appropriate information
• explore relevant resources; analyse, discuss and evaluate images, objects
and artefacts; and make and record independent judgements
• use knowledge and understanding of the work of others to develop and
extend thinking and inform own work
• generate and explore potential lines of enquiry using appropriate media
and techniques
• apply knowledge and understanding in making images and artefacts;
review and modify work; plan and develop ideas in the light of their own
and others’ evaluations
• organise, select and communicate ideas, solutions and responses, and
present them in a range of visual, tactile and/or sensory forms.
Version 1.7 © OCR 2024
A Level in Art and Design 9
Core Knowledge and Learners are required to develop practical and theoretical knowledge and
Understanding understanding of:
• relevant materials, processes, technologies and resources
• how ideas, feelings and meanings can be conveyed and interpreted in
images and artefacts
• how images and artefacts relate to the time and place in which they were
made and to their social and cultural contexts
2 • continuity and change in different genres, styles and traditions
• a working vocabulary and specialist terminology.
