Table 2 Common Practical Assessment Criteria (CPAC) for the assessment of practical competency in A Level
sciences
Competency Practical Mastery
In order to be awarded a Pass a Learner must, by the end of the practical science
assessment, consistently and routinely meet the criteria in respect of each
competency listed below. A Learner may demonstrate the competencies in any
practical activity undertaken as part of that assessment throughout the course of
study.
Learners may undertake practical activities in groups. However, the evidence
generated by each Learner must demonstrate that he or she independently meets
the criteria outlined below in respect of each competency. Such evidence –
a) will comprise both the Learner’s performance during each practical activity and
his or her contemporaneous record of the work that he or she has undertaken
during that activity, and
b) must include evidence of independent application of investigative approaches
and methods to practical work.
(1) Follows written a) Correctly follows instructions to carry out experimental techniques or
procedures procedures.

(2) Applies investigative a) Correctly uses appropriate instrumentation, apparatus and materials (including
approaches and ICT) to carry out investigative activities, experimental techniques and procedures

combination, identifying practical issues and making adjustments when necessary.
c) Identifies and controls significant quantitative variables where applicable, and
plans approaches to take account of variables that cannot readily be controlled.
d) Selects appropriate equipment and measurement strategies in order to ensure
suitably accurate results.
(3) Safely uses a range of a) Identifies hazards and assesses risks associated with these hazards, making
practical equipment and safety adjustments as necessary, when carrying out experimental techniques and
materials procedures in the lab or field.
b) Uses appropriate safety equipment and approaches to minimise risks with
minimal prompting.
(4) Makes and records a) Makes accurate observations relevant to the experimental or investigative
observations procedure.
b) Obtains accurate, precise and sufficient data for experimental and investigative
procedures and records this methodically using appropriate units and conventions.
(5) Researches, a) Uses appropriate software and/or tools to process data, carry out research and
references and reports report findings.
b) Cites sources of information, demonstrating that research has taken place,
supporting planning and conclusions.
