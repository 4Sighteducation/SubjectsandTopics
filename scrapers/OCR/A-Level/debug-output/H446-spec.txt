To get the length of a string:
stringname.length
To get a substring:
stringname.subString(startingPosition, numberOfCharacters)
NB The string will start with the 0th character.
Example
someText=”Computer Science”
print(someText.length)
print(someText.substring(3,3))

function triple(number)
return number*3
endfunction
Called from main program
y=triple(7)
procedure greeting(name)
print(“hello”+name)
endprocedure
Called from main program
greeting(“Hamish”)
Unless stated values passed to subroutines can be assumed to be passed by value.
If this is relevant to the question byVal and byRef will be used. In the case below x is passed by value and y is
passed by reference.
procedure foobar(x:byVal, y:byRef)

Arrays
Arrays will be 0 based and declared with the keyword array.
array names[5]
names[0]=”Ahmad”
names[1]=”Ben”
names[2]=”Catherine”

Reading to and Writing from Files
To open a file to read from openRead is used and readLine to return a line of text from the file.
The following program makes x the first line of sample.txt
5
myFile = openRead(“sample.txt”)
x = myFile.readLine()
myFile.close()
is used to determine the end of the file. The following program will print out the contents of
endOfFile()
sample.txt
myFile = openRead(“sample.txt”)
while NOT myFile.endOfFile()
print(myFile.readLine())
endwhile
myFile.close()
To open a file to write to openWrite is used and writeLine to add a line of text to the file. In the program below
hello world is made the contents of sample.txt (any previous contents are overwritten).
myFile = openWrite(“sample.txt”)
myFile.writeLine(“Hello World”)
myFile.close()
Comments
Comments are denoted by //
print(“Hello World”) //This is a comment

Object-Oriented
Object oriented code will match the pseudocode listed above with the following extensions:
Methods and Attributes:
Methods and attributes can be assumed to be public unless otherwise stated. Where the access level is relevant to
the question it will always be explicit in the code denoted by the keywords.
public and private.
private attempts = 3
public procedure setAttempts(number)
attempts=number
endprocedure
public function getAttempts()
return attempts
endfunction
Methods will always be instance methods, learners aren’t expected to be aware of static methods. They will be
called using object.method so

print(player.getAttempts())
Constructors and Inheritance
Inheritance is denoted by the keyword, superclass methods will be called with the keyword super.

JavaScript
Learners are expected to be able to follow and write basic JavaScript code. It is hoped they will get practical
experience of JavaScript in their study of the course. They will not be expected to commit exact details of syntax
to memory. Questions in the exam will not penalise learners for minor inaccuracies in syntax. Learners will be
expected to be familiar with the JavaScript equivalents of the structures listed in the pseudocode section (with
the exception of input and output (see below). They will not be expected to use JavaScript for Object Oriented
programming or file handling. Questions will not be asked in JavaScript where something is passed to a subroutine
by value or reference is relevant.
Input
Input will be taken in by reading values from a form. NB learners will not be expected to memorise the method for
doing this as focus will be on what they do with that input once it is received.
Output
By changing the contents of an HTML element
chosenElement = document.getElementById(“example”);
chosenElement.innerHTML = “Hello World”;
By writing directly to the document
5
document.write(“Hello World”);
By using an alert box
alert(“Hello World”);
Any other JavaScript used will be explained in the question.

In questions mnemonics will always be given according to the left hand column below. Different implementations
of LMC have slight variations in mnemonics used and to take this into account the alternative mnemonics in the
