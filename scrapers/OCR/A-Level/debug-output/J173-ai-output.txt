1.1.5 Knowledge and Understanding
1.1.5.1 Learners are required to demonstrate the knowledge and understanding listed below through practical application of skills to realise personal intentions relevant to their chosen area(s) of Photography.
1.1.5.2 Learners are required to know and understand how sources inspire the development of their ideas.
1.1.5.3 Reference should be made to the following:
1.1.5.3.1 The work and approaches of photographers from contemporary and/or historical contexts, periods, societies and cultures.
1.1.5.3.2 Contemporary and/or historical environments, situations or issues.
1.1.5.3.3 Other relevant sources researched by the learner in their chosen area(s) of photography.

1.1.5.3.4.2 Line
1.1.5.3.4.3 Form
1.1.5.3.4.4 Tone

1.1.5.3.5 The characteristics, properties and effects of using different media, materials, techniques and processes, and the ways in which they can be used in relation to learners’ own creative intentions and chosen area(s) of Photography.
1.1.5.3.6 The different purposes, intentions and functions of photography in a variety of contexts and as appropriate to learners’ own work.
1.2 Component 02: Externally set task
1.2.1 Overview
1.2.1.1 For this component, an early release paper will be despatched to centres based on estimated entries made and will also be available on the OCR website from 2 January.
1.2.1.2 This paper can be given to learners at the discretion of centres any time on or after 2 January in the year of certification. Centres may determine the amount of time for preparatory study prior to learners undertaking their 10-hour supervised time period.
1.2.1.3 The paper will give learners a choice of five themes, each with a choice of written and/or visual starting points or stimuli. From this paper, learners are expected to choose one option for which they will generate an appropriate personal response of one or more artefact(s)/product(s)/personal outcome(s) within a 10-hour supervised time period. The paper will also give the learner an opportunity to develop an extended response.
1.2.2 Planning and preparation
1.2.2.1 The amount of time given to learners for the preparation period should be determined by centres.
1.2.2.2 Learners must be given a preparatory period during which they will research, plan and develop ideas for their own response to the option they have chosen. Guidance should be given to learners about availability and choice of materials, health and safety, avoidance of plagiarism and completion of work in accordance with specification requirements and procedures. However, it should be remembered that learners are required to reach their own judgements and conclusions and must work independently to produce their own personal response.
1.2.2.3 All work must be completed by the designated finishing time set by the centre. Dates and deadlines for preparatory work and the 10-hour supervised time, must be set by centres in order to facilitate the completion of marking and internal standardisation by the OCR-set deadline.
1.2.2.4 Learners can continue to work on their preparatory work until the first period of supervised time commences, after which, preparatory work must not be amended or developed further. Learners must refer to their preparatory work during the 10-hour supervised time period.
1.2.2.5 Following the commencement of the 10-hour supervised time period:
1.2.2.5.1 Each learner’s preparatory materials/work are stored securely by a centre.
1.2.2.5.2 A learner may not alter his or her preparatory materials/work.
1.2.2.5.3 Each learner is allowed to access his or her preparatory materials/work only while taking the assessment. Learners must not do additional work between the supervised sessions.
1.2.2.5.4 No learner is allowed access to any other learner’s preparatory materials/work.
1.2.3 Realising intentions
1.2.3.1 Learners will have up to 10 hours in which to independently realise their response(s) through the production of one or more artefact(s)/product(s)/personal outcome(s). Within the 10-hour supervised time period, learners are required to provide evidence of all assessment objectives in response to their chosen starting point or stimulus.
1.2.3.2 The 10-hour supervised time period can be divided into a number of sessions and timetabled to suit the centre. At least one session should be at least 2 hours in duration. Centres should ensure that short sessions are avoided. All work must be kept securely between sessions. Learners must not do or bring any additional work into any of the supervised sessions.
1.2.3.3 The 10-hour supervised time period should be conducted under formal examination conditions. For regulations governing examinations, centres should consult the OCR website and the JCQ Instructions for conducting examinations.
1.2.3.4 All selected work produced for the component, including the research, planning and development work produced in the preparatory period must be submitted for assessment.
1.2.3.5 The Externally set task is marked using the relevant marking criteria for the Externally set task in Section 3f.
