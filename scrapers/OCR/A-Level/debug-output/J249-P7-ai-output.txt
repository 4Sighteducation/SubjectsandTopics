1.1 P7.1 Work done
1.1.1 P7.1a describe for situations where there are energy transfers in a system, that there is no net change to the total energy of a closed system (qualitative only)
1.1.1.1 the law of conservation of energy
1.1.2 P7.1b describe all the changes involved in the way energy is stored when a system changes for common situations
1.1.2.1 an object projected upwards or up a slope
1.1.2.2 a moving object hitting an obstacle
1.1.2.3 an object being accelerated by a constant force
1.1.2.4 a vehicle slowing down
1.1.2.5 bringing water to a boil in an electric kettle
1.1.3 P7.1c describe the changes in energy involved when a system is changed by heating (in terms of temperature change and specific heat capacity), by work done by forces, and by work done when a current flows
1.1.4 P7.1d make calculations of the energy changes associated with changes in a system, recalling or selecting the relevant equations for mechanical, electrical, and thermal processes; thereby express in quantitative form and on a common scale the overall redistribution of energy in the system
1.1.4.1 work done by forces
1.1.4.2 current flow
1.1.4.3 through heating
1.1.4.4 the use of kW h to measure energy use in electrical appliances in the home

1.2 P7.2 Power and efficiency
1.2.1 P7.2a describe, with examples, the process by which energy is dissipated, so that it is stored in less useful ways
1.2.2 P7.2b describe how, in different domestic devices, energy is transferred from batteries or the a.c. from the mains
1.2.2.1 how energy may be wasted in the transfer to and within motors and heating devices
1.2.3 P7.2c describe, with examples, the relationship between the power ratings for domestic electrical appliances and how this is linked to the changes in stored energy when they are in use
1.2.4 P7.2d calculate energy efficiency for any energy transfer
1.2.5 P7.2e describe ways to increase efficiency
1.2.6 P7.2f explain ways of reducing unwanted energy transfer
1.2.6.1 lubrication and thermal insulation
1.2.7 P7.2g describe how the rate of cooling of a building is affected by the thickness and thermal conductivity of its walls (qualitative only)
