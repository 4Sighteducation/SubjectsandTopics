1.1 P1.1 The particle model
1.1.1 P1.1a describe how and why the atomic model has changed over time
1.1.1.1 Thomson, Rutherford and Marsden
1.1.1.2 Bohr models
1.1.2 P1.1b describe the atom as a positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons, with the nuclear radius much smaller than that of the atom and with almost all of the mass in the nucleus
1.1.3 P1.1c recall the typical size (order of magnitude) of atoms and small molecules
1.1.3.1 knowledge that it is typically 1 × 10–10m
1.1.4 P1.1d define density
1.1.5 P1.1e explain the differences in density between the different states of matter in terms of the arrangements of the atoms and molecules
1.1.6 P1.1f apply the relationship between density, mass and volume to changes where mass is conserved

1.2 P1.2 Changes of state
1.2.1 P1.2a describe how mass is conserved when substances melt, freeze, evaporate, condense or sublimate
1.2.2 P1.2b describe that physical changes differ from chemical changes because the material recovers its original properties if the change is reversed
1.2.3 P1.2c describe how heating a system will change the energy stored within the system and raise its temperature or produce changes of state
1.2.4 P1.2d define the term specific heat capacity and specific latent heat and distinguish between it and the term specific latent heat vaporisation
1.2.5 P1.2e apply the relationship between change in internal energy of a material and its mass, specific heat capacity and temperature change to calculate the energy change involved
1.2.6 P1.2f apply the relationship between specific latent heat and mass to calculate the energy change involved in a change of state

1.3 P1.3 Pressure
1.3.1 P1.3a explain how the motion of the molecules in a gas is related both to its temperature and its pressure
1.3.1.1 application to closed systems only
1.3.2 P1.3b explain the relationship between the temperature of a gas and its pressure at constant volume (qualitative only)
1.3.3 P1.3c recall that gases can be compressed or expanded by pressure changes and that the pressure produces a net force at right angles to any surface
1.3.4 P1.3d explain how increasing the volume in which a gas is contained, at constant temperature can lead to a decrease in pressure
1.3.4.1 behaviour regarding particle velocity and collisions
1.3.5 P1.3e explain how doing work on a gas can increase its temperature
1.3.5.1 examples such as a bicycle pump
1.3.6 P1.3f describe a simple model of the Earth’s atmosphere and of atmospheric pressure
1.3.6.1 an assumption of uniform density; knowledge of layers is not expected
1.3.7 P1.3g explain why atmospheric pressure varies with height above the surface of the planet
1.3.8 P1.3h describe the factors which influence floating and sinking
1.3.9 P1.3i explain why pressure in a liquid varies with depth and density and how this leads to an upwards force on a partially submerged object
1.3.10 P1.3j calculate the differences in pressure at different depths in a liquid
1.3.10.1 knowledge that g is the strength of the gravitational field and has a value of 10 N/kg near the Earth’s surface
