I apologize, but the text you've provided does not contain the specific content for "The Rise of Macedon, 359–323 BC" topic with its time periods and content points. The document appears to be a general specification overview for the OCR A-Level Ancient History course. To extract the detailed content, I would need to see the actual section describing the time periods and learning objectives for this specific topic.
