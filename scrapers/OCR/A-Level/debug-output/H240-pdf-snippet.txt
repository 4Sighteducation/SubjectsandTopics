2f. Detailed Content of A Level Mathematics A (H240)
1 – Pure Mathematics
When this course is being co-taught with AS Level Mathematics A (H230) the ‘Stage 1’ column indicates the common content between the two specifications and the
‘Stage 2’ column indicates content which is particular to this specification.

1.01 Proof
1.01a Proof a) Understand and be able to use the structure of d) Understand and be able to use proof by MA1
1.01d mathematical proof, proceeding from given contradiction.

In particular, learners should understand a proof of the
conclusion.
irrationality of 2 and the infinity of primes.
In particular, learners should use methods of proof
Questions requiring proof by contradiction will be set on
including proof by deduction and proof by exhaustion.
content with which the learner is expected to be familiar
1.01b b) Understand and be able to use the logical e.g. through study of GCSE (9–1), AS or A Level

connectives /, , . Mathematics.
Learners should be familiar with the language associated
with the logical connectives: “congruence”, “if..... then”
and “if and only if” (or “iff”).
1.01c c) Be able to show disproof by counter example.
Learners should understand that this means that, given a
statement of the form “if P(x) is true then Q(x) is true”,
finding a single x for which P(x) is true but Q(x) is false is to
offer a disproof by counter example.
Questions requiring proof will be set on content with which
the learner is expected to be familiar e.g. through study of
GCSE (9–1) or AS Level Mathematics.
Learners are expected to understand and be able to use
terms such as “integer”, “real”, “rational” and “irrational”.

1.02 Algebra and Functions
1.02a Indices a) Understand and be able to use the laws of indices MB1
for all rational exponents.
Includes negative and zero indices.
Problems may involve the application of more than one
of the following laws:
xa#xb =xa+b, xa'xb =xa-b,( xa)b =xab

x-a = , xm =n xm , x0 =1 .
xa n
1.02b Surds b) Be able to use and manipulate surds, including MB2
rationalising the denominator.
Learners should understand and use the equivalence of
surd and index notation.
1.02c Simultaneous c) Be able to solve simultaneous equations in two MB4
equations variables by elimination and by substitution,
including one linear and one quadratic equation.
The equations may contain brackets and/or fractions.
e.g.
y=4-3 x and y=x2+2x-2
2 xy+y2 =4 and 2 x+3 y =9
