Topic C5: Monitoring and controlling chemical reactions
C5.1 Monitoring chemical reactions
Summary Common misconceptions
This topic tackles the relationship of moles to the concentration of a solution The most common problem learners’ encounter with these calculations is their lack
and the volume of a gas. It also tackles the calculation of the mass of a substance of understanding of ratios. Also most learners think that the mole and mass are the
