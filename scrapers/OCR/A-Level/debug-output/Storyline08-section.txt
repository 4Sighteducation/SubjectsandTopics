Oceans (O)
The storyline begins by looking at how the oceans Finally, the storyline returns to the redistribution of

involved. The chemical ideas in this module are:
A study of the role of the oceans in redistributing • dissolving and associated enthalpy changes

energy from the Sun next forms the context for
• the greenhouse effect
introducing the greenhouse effect. The absorption
of CO by the oceans also provides the basis for • acid–base equilibria and pH

introduction of acid–base equilibria, including
• solubility products
Brønsted–Lowry theory, pH calculations, strong
and weak acids, and buffers. The role of calcium
• entropy.
carbonate in seashells as a carbon store then leads into
understanding of solubility products.
