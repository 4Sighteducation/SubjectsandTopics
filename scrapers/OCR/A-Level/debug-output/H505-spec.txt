About our new name
i
As of September 2025, our name is Cambridge OCR.
Students who sat an exam in summer 2025 will receive a Cambridge OCR branded exam certificate
(our new brand), which will be the same for all future exam series.
You’ll continue to see the OCR or Oxford Cambridge and RSA Examinations name while we work
to update our material to our new name, Cambridge OCR. This will take some time, and you can still
access all up-to-date qualification resources and materials via Teach Cambridge.
Important: We’ll keep the OCR/Oxford Cambridge and RSA name on existing teaching resources
while the content of these remains applicable to the specification being taught. New and refreshed
resources will be produced using the Cambridge OCR name/logo.
Are you using the latest version of this specification?
The latest version of our specifications will always be on our website and may differ from printed versions.
We will inform centres about changes to specifications.
Tell us what you think
Your feedback plays an important role in how we develop, market, support and resource qualifications now and
into the future. We want you and your students to enjoy and get the best out of our qualifications and resources,
but to do that we need your honest opinions to tell us whether we’re on the right track or not.
You can email your thoughts to support@ocr.org.uk or visit our feedback page to learn more about how you can
