Topic P8: Global challenges
This topic seeks to integrate learners’ knowledge and understanding of physical systems and processes, with the aim of applying it to global challenges. Applications of
physics can be used to help humans improve their own lives and strive to create a sustainable world for future generations, and these challenges are considered in this
topic. It therefore provides opportunities to draw together the concepts covered in earlier topics, allowing synoptic treatment of the subject of physics.
