I apologize, but I cannot find the specific content for "The Culture and Politics of Athens, c.460–399 BC" in the provided PDF text. The excerpt appears to be a general introduction to the OCR A-Level Ancient History specification, but does not include the detailed content for this specific topic. To accurately extract the time periods and content, I would need to see the full page or section that contains the detailed specification for this topic.
