1.1 B4.1 Ecosystems
1.1.1 B4.1a recall that many different materials cycle through the abiotic and biotic components of an ecosystem
1.1.1.1 nitrogen
1.1.1.2 carbon
1.1.2 B4.1b explain the role of microorganisms in the cycling of materials through an ecosystem
1.1.2.1 decomposition
1.1.3 B4.1c explain the importance of the carbon cycle and the water cycle to living organisms
1.1.3.1 maintaining habitats
1.1.3.2 fresh water
1.1.3.3 flow of nutrients
1.1.3.4 stages of the carbon and water cycles
1.1.4 B4.1d explain the effect of factors such as temperature, water content, and oxygen availability on rate of decomposition
1.1.4.1 aerobic
1.1.4.2 anaerobic
1.1.5 B4.1e describe different levels of organisation in an ecosystem from individual organisms to the whole ecosystem
1.1.6 B4.1f explain how abiotic and biotic factors can affect communities
1.1.6.1 temperature
1.1.6.2 light intensity
1.1.6.3 moisture level
1.1.6.4 pH of soil
1.1.6.5 predators

1.1.7 B4.1g describe the importance of interdependence and competition in a community
1.1.7.1 predation
1.1.7.2 mutualism
1.1.7.3 parasitism
1.1.8 B4.1h describe the differences between the trophic levels of organisms within an ecosystem
1.1.8.1 producer
1.1.8.2 consumer
1.1.9 B4.1i describe pyramids of biomass and explain, with examples, how biomass is lost between the different trophic levels
1.1.9.1 loss of biomass related to egestion
1.1.9.2 excretion
1.1.9.3 respiration
1.1.10 B4.1j calculate the efficiency of biomass transfers between trophic levels and explain how this affects the number of trophic levels in a food chain
