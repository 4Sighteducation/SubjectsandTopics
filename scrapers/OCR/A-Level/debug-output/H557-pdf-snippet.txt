2b. Content of A Level in Physics B (Advancing Physics) (H557)
The A Level in Physics B specification content is divided A summary of the content for the A level course is as
into six teaching modules. Each module is introduced follows:
with a summary of the physics it contains and each
topic is also introduced with a short summary text. Module 1 – Development of practical skills in physics
The assessable content is divided into two columns:
1.1 Practical skills assessed in a written examination
Learning outcomes and Additional guidance.
1.2 Practical skills assessed in the practical
2 The Learning outcomes may all be assessed in the endorsement
examinations (with the exception of some of the skills
in module 1.2 which will be assessed directly through Module 2 – Fundamental data analysis
the Practical Endorsement). The Additional guidance
Module 3 – Physics in action
column is included to provide further advice on
delivery and the expected skills required from learners.
3.1.1 Imaging and signalling
References to HSW (Section 5d) are included in the 3.1.2 Sensing
guidance to highlight opportunities to encourage a
3.2 Mechanical properties of materials
wider understanding of science.
Module 4 – Understanding processes
The mathematical requirements in Section 5e are also
referenced by the prefix M to link the mathematical 4.1 Waves and quantum behaviour
skills required for A Level Physics to examples of the
4.2 Space, time and motion
physics content where those mathematical skills could
be linked to learning. Module 5 – Rise and fall of the clockwork universe
The specification has been designed to be co-teachable 5.1.1 Creating models
with the standalone AS Level in Physics B (Advancing
5.1.2 Out into space
Physics) qualification. The first four modules comprise
5.1.3 Our place in the universe
the AS in Physics B (Advancing Physics) course and
learners studying the A level continue with the content 5.2.1 Matter: very simple
of modules 5 and 6 in year 13.
5.2.2 Matter: hot or cold
The Data, Formulae and Relationships booklet in
Module 6 – Field and particle physics
Section 5c will be available in examinations and
learners are expected to become familiar with this 6.1.1 Electromagnetism
booklet throughout the course.
6.1.2 Charge and field
6.2.1 Probing deep into matter
6.2.2 Ionising radiation and risk.
