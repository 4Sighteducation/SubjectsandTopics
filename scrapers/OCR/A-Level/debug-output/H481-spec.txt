4. Geographical Skills
4.1 Geographical information:
With respect to geographical information, learners should:
a) understand what makes data geographical
b) understand the ethical and socio-political implications of collecting, studying and representing
geographical data, especially with regard to human communities
2 c) understand the nature of and use different types of geographical information, including:
•• qualitative and quantitative
•• primary and secondary

d) collect, analyse and interpret such information, and demonstrate the ability to understand and apply
suitable analytical approaches for the different information types
e) undertake informed and critical questioning of data sources, analytical methodologies, data reporting
and presentation, including the ability to identify sources of error in data and to identify the misuse of
data
f) communicate and evaluate findings, draw well-evidenced conclusions informed by wider theory, and
construct extended written argument about geographical matters.
4.2 Geo-located data:
With respect to geo-located data, learners should:
a) demonstrate an ability to collect and to use digital data through the use of geospatial technologies,
such as smart phones and tablet devices
b) understand the opportunities and benefits of presenting and analysing geographical data through the
use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS).
4.3 Qualitative skills:
With respect to qualitative skills, learners should:
a) use and understand a mixture of methodological approaches, including using interviews
b) interpret, analyse and evaluate a range of source material including textual and visual sources
c) understand the opportunities and limitations of qualitative techniques such as coding and sampling.
4.4 Quantitative skills:
With respect to quantitative skills, learners should understand the purposes and difference between the
following and be able to use them in appropriate contexts:
a) mean, median, mode, range, interquartile range and standard deviation
b) tests of association and significance tests, such as Chi-squared, Spearman’s rank, Mann-Whitney U test
and T-test
c) lines of best fit and correlation on graphical representations
d) measurement, measurement errors, and sampling.

With respect to fieldwork skills, A Level Geography requires learners to:
a) define the research questions which underpin field investigations
b) research relevant literature sources and understand and write up the theoretical or comparative
context for a research question
c) observe and record phenomena in the field and devise and justify practical approaches taken in the
field including frequency/timing of observation, sampling, and data collection approaches
d) demonstrate practical knowledge and understanding of appropriate field methodologies
e) implement chosen methodologies to collect data/information of good quality and relevant to the topic
under investigation
f) demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the techniques appropriate for analysing field data and
information and for representing results, and show ability to select suitable quantitative or qualitative
approaches and to apply them
g) demonstrate the ability to interrogate and critically examine field data in order to comment on its
accuracy and/or the extent to which it is representative, and use the experience to extend
geographical understanding
h) apply existing knowledge, theory and concepts to order and understand field observations
i) show the ability to write up field results clearly and logically, using a range of presentation methods
j) evaluate and reflect on fieldwork investigations, explain how the results relate to the wider context
and show an understanding of the ethical dimensions of field research
k) demonstrate the ability to write a coherent analysis of fieldwork findings in order to answer a specific
