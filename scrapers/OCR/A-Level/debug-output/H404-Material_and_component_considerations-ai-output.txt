5. Material and component considerations

5.1 What factors influence the selection of materials that are used in products?
5.1.1 Understand that the selection of materials and components is influenced by a range of factors, including:
5.1.1.1 functional performance
5.1.1.2 aesthetics
5.1.1.3 cost and availability
5.1.1.4 properties and characteristics
5.1.1.5 environmental considerations
5.1.1.6 social, cultural and ethical factors.

5.2 What materials and components should be selected when designing and manufacturing products and prototypes in Design Engineering?
5.2.1 Understand that most products consist of multiple materials and that design engineers are required to discriminate between them appropriately for their use, including:
5.2.1.1 ferrous, non-ferrous and alloy metals, such as:
5.2.1.1.1 mild steel, aluminium and brass.
5.2.1.2 thermo softening and thermosetting polymers, such as:
5.2.1.2.1 HIPS, ABS and polyester resin, epoxy resin and polyimides.
5.2.1.3 timbers and manufactured boards, such as:
5.2.1.3.1 oak, plywood and MDF.
5.2.1.4 textiles used for reinforcement and coverings, such as:
5.2.1.4.1 geotextiles used in civil engineering and construction.
5.2.1.5 composite materials, such as:
5.2.1.5.1 fibre-reinforced plastics, glass-reinforced plastics (GRP) and carbon fibre (CFRP).
5.2.1.6 smart materials, such as:
5.2.1.6.1 shape memory alloy, motion control gel, self-healing materials, thermochromic, photochromic and electrochromic materials.
5.2.1.7 modern materials, such as:
5.2.1.7.1 sandwich panels, e-textiles, rare earth magnets, high performance alloys and super-alloys, graphene and carbon nanotubes.

5.3 Why is it important to consider the properties/characteristics of materials when designing and manufacturing products?
5.3.1 Understand the characteristics and properties of materials that are significant in Design Engineering, such as:
5.3.1.1 density, tensile strength, strength to weight ratio, hardness, durability, thermal and electrical conductivity, corrosion resistance, stiffness, elasticity, plasticity, impact resistance, malleability and ductility, machinability.
5.3.2 Understand how the available forms, costs and properties of materials contribute to the decisions about suitability of materials when developing and manufacturing their own products.
