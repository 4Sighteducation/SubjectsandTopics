B4.1 Ecosystems
Summary Common misconceptions
Microorganisms play an important role in the continuous cycling of chemicals Research has shown that it is easier for a learner to explain the consequences
in ecosystems. Biotic and abiotic factors interact in an ecosystem and have an on a food web if the producers are removed for some reason than if the top
effect on communities. Living organisms form populations of single species, predators are taken away. It is also better to start off explaining ideas relating to
communities of many species and are part of ecosystems. Living organisms are food webs using small simple webs with animals and plants that learners are

of a food web quite difficult for some.
