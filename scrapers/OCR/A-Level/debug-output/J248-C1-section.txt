state occurs. They should also be familiar with changes of state in terms of the
particle model. Learners should have sufficient grounding in the particle model
to be able to apply it to unfamiliar materials and contexts.

C1.2 Atomic structure
Summary Common misconceptions
An atom is the smallest component of an element that gives an element its Learners commonly have difficulty understanding the concept of isotopes due

Current models suggest that atoms are made of smaller sub-atomic particles neutrons. They also find it difficult to distinguish between the properties of
called protons, neutrons and electrons. They suggest that atoms are composed atoms and molecules. Another common misconception is that a positive ion gains

protons. Atoms of each element have the same number of protons as electrons. the atom rather than a change in the number of electrons.
Atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons. Atoms of the
same element will have the same number of protons but may have different Tiering
numbers of neutrons. Statements shown in bold type will only be tested in the Higher Tier papers.
All other statements will be assessed in both Foundation and Higher Tier papers.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with the simple (Dalton) atomic model.
