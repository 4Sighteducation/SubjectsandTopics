1. the terms: exothermic, endothermic, standard conditions, (standard) enthalpy change of reaction (∆H), (standard) enthalpy change of combustion (∆H), (standard) enthalpy change of formation (∆H), (standard) enthalpy change of neutralisation (∆H)
2. the term average bond enthalpy and the relation of bond enthalpy to the length and strength of a bond; bond-breaking as an endothermic process and bond-making as exothermic; the relation of these processes to the overall enthalpy change for a reaction
3. techniques and procedures for measuring the energy transferred when reactions occur in solution (or solids reacting with solutions) or when flammable liquids burn; the calculation of enthalpy changes from experimental results
4. the determination of enthalpy changes of reaction from enthalpy cycles and enthalpy level diagrams based on Hess’ law
5. the terms catalyst, catalysis, catalyst poison, heterogeneous
6. a simple model to explain the function of a heterogeneous catalyst
7. the term cracking; the use of catalysts in cracking processes; techniques and procedures for cracking a hydrocarbon vapour over a heated catalyst and testing the product
8. the origin of atmospheric pollutants from a variety of sources: particulates, unburnt hydrocarbons, CO, CO₂, NOₓ, SOₓ; the environmental implications and methods of reducing these pollutants
