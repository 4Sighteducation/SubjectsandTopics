Content of Pure Core (Mandatory papers Y540 and Y541)
When this course is being co-taught with OCR’s AS Level Further Mathematics A (H235) the ‘Stage 1’ column indicates the common content between the two specifications
and the ‘Stage 2’ column indicates content which is particular to this specification. In each section the OCR Reference lists ‘Stage 1’ statements before ‘Stage 2’ statements.

4.02 Complex Numbers
4.02a The language of a) Understand the language of complex numbers. B2
complex B5
Know the meaning of “real part”, “imaginary part”,
numbers B3
“conjugate”, “modulus” and “argument” of a complex
number.
4.02b b) Be able to express a complex number z in either d) Understand and be able to use the exponential form, B9
4.02d cartesian form z =x+iy, where r eii, of a complex number.
i2 =-1
, or modulus-argument form
z =r (cosi+isini)=[ r ,i] =r cisi, where r $0
is the modulus of z and i, measured in radians is
the argument of z.
4.02c c) Understand and be able to use the notation:
Re Im arg
z, z*, z , z , z , z .
^ h ^ h ^ h
Includes knowing that a complex number is zero if and
only if both the real and imaginary parts are zero.
The principal argument of a complex number, for
uniqueness, will be taken to lie in either of the intervals
0, 2r or -r,r . Learners may use either as
6 h ^ @
appropriate unless the interval is specified.
In stage 1 knowledge of radians is assumed: see H240
section 1.05d.
