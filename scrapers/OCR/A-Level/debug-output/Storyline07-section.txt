Polymers and life (PL)
(c) DNA and RNA as condensation polymers formed Monomers of DNA and RNA are given on the Data
from nucleotides, which are monomers having Sheet.
three components (phosphate, sugar and base):
(i) the phosphate units join by condensation
with deoxyribose or ribose to form the
phosphate–sugar backbone in DNA and RNA
2
(ii) the four bases present in DNA and RNA join
by condensation with the deoxyribose or
ribose in the phosphate–sugar backbone
(iii) two strands of DNA form a double-helix
structure through base pairing
(d) the significance of hydrogen bonding in the Some triplet base codes are given on the Data Sheet.
pairing of bases in DNA and relation to the
replication of genetic information; how DNA
encodes for RNA which codes for an amino acid
sequence in a protein
(e) molecular recognition (the structure and action
of a given pharmacologically active material) in
terms of:
(i) the pharmacophore and groups that modify
it
(ii) its interaction with receptor sites
(iii) the ways that species interact in three
dimensions (size, shape, bond formation,
orientation)
Kinetics
(f) the shape of the rate versus substrate At low concentrations of substrate the order
concentration curve for an enzyme-catalysed with respect to the substrate is one, at higher
reaction; techniques and procedures for concentrations of substrate the order with respect
experiments involving enzymes to the substrate is zero.

specificity, temperature sensitivity, pH sensitivity,
competitive inhibition;
explanation of these characteristics of enzyme
catalysis in terms of a three-dimensional active
site (part of the tertiary structure)
