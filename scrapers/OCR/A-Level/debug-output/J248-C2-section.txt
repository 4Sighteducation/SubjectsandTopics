Topic C2: Elements, compounds and mixtures
C2.1 Purity and separating mixtures

Underlying knowledge and understanding All other statements will be assessed in both Foundation and Higher Tier papers.
Learners should be familiar with the concept of pure substances. They should
have met simple separation techniques of mixtures: filtration, evaporation and
distillation. The identification of pure substances in terms of melting point, boiling
point and chromatography will also have been met before.
