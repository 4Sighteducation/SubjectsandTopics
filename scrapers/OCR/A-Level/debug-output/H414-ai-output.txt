1 Module 2: Foundations in geology
1.1 2.1 Minerals and rocks
1.1.1 2.1.1 Minerals
1.1.1.1 (a) minerals as naturally occurring elements and inorganic compounds whose composition can be expressed as a chemical formula
1.1.1.2 (b) rock-forming silicate minerals as crystalline materials built up from silicon–oxygen tetrahedra to form frameworks, sheets or chains and which may have a range of compositions (qualitative only)
1.1.1.3 (c) the diagnostic physical properties of rock-forming minerals in hand specimens
1.1.1.3.1 (i) the diagnostic physical properties of rock-forming minerals in hand specimens
1.1.1.3.2 (ii) the classification of samples, photographs and thin section diagrams
1.1.2 2.1.2 Igneous rocks
1.1.2.1 (a) the classification of igneous rocks on the basis of their composition
2 Module 3: Global tectonics
2.1 3.1 Earth structure
2.1.1 3.1.1 The physical structure of the Earth
2.1.1.1 (a) the layered structures of the Earth as defined by the rheological properties of the layers
2.1.1.2 (b) how the variation in P and S wave velocities provides indirect evidence to identify layers within the Earth and how their paths through the Earth produces the P wave and S wave shadow zones
2.1.1.3 (c) the lithosphere as a rigid, brittle layer made of the crust and part of the upper mantle, which is divided into plates
2.1.1.4 (d) how evidence from gravity anomalies and isostasy provides indirect evidence to determine the behaviour of the lithosphere and asthenosphere
2.1.1.5 (e) how indirect evidence from electromagnetic (EM) surveys may be used to identify the lithosphere and asthenosphere at mid-ocean ridges
2.1.1.6 (f) the nature of the asthenosphere as a rheid, plastic layer with 1–5% partial melting
2.1.1.7 (g) how the density of the whole Earth and the rocks at the surface provide indirect evidence to infer the density of the core and mantle rocks
2.1.1.8 (h) the probable geodynamo origin of the Earth’s magnetic field which provides indirect evidence for the subdivision of the core
2.1.2 3.1.2 The origin of the Earth’s structure
2.1.2.1 (a) the bulk composition of the Earth and how it is inferred from the composition of meteorites (chondrites) and the Sun
2.1.2.2 (b) a qualitative explanation of the nebular hypothesis for the formation of the solar system and the Earth
2.1.2.3 (c) the transfer of geothermal energy from:
2.1.2.3.1 (i) heat of formation by the Earth
2.1.2.3.2 (ii) radioactive decay within the Earth
2.1.2.4 (d) the Goldschmidt classification of elements into four groups and a qualitative understanding of the preferred formation of states of substances (oxides and sulfides)
2.1.2.5 (e) the differentiation of the Earth into layers of distinct composition and density by the partitioning of each of the Goldschmidt groups between the crust, mantle, core, and atmosphere and hydrosphere
2.1.2.6 (f) the geochemical layered structure of the Earth as defined by the mineral composition of the layers and how the composition of these layers is inferred from direct evidence
