I apologize, but there appears to be an incomplete or cut-off specification text for Unit Y223 in the PDF excerpt you shared. Without the full text, I cannot accurately extract the detailed sub-topics.

However, for the other Units in the document (Y201-Y222), I can help you extract the detailed sub-topics for any specific unit following the formatting rules you outlined. Would you like me to extract the sub-topics for a different unit?

If you want the sub-topics for Y223: The Cold War in Europe 1941–1995, could you provide the complete specification text? I'll be happy to help once I have the full content.
