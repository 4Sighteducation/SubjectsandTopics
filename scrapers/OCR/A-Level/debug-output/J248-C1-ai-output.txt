1.1 C1.1 The particle model
1.1.1 C1.1a describe the main features of the particle model in terms of states of matter and change of state
1.1.2 C1.1b explain in terms of the particle model the distinction between physical changes and chemical changes
1.1.3 C1.1c explain the limitations of the particle model in relation to changes of state when particles are represented by inelastic spheres (e.g. like bowling balls)
1.1.3.1 that it does not take into account the forces of attraction between particles
1.1.3.2 the size of particles and the space between them

1.2 C1.2 Atomic structure
1.2.1 C1.2a describe how and why the atomic model has changed over time
1.2.1.1 the models of Dalton, Thomson, Rutherford, Bohr, Geiger and Marsden
1.2.2 C1.2b describe the atom as a positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons, with the nuclear radius much smaller than that of the atom and with most of the mass in the nucleus
1.2.3 C1.2c recall the typical size (order of magnitude) of atoms and small molecules
1.2.3.1 the concept that typical atomic radii and bond length are in the order of 10–10m
1.2.4 C1.2d recall relative charges and approximate relative masses of protons, neutrons and electrons
1.2.5 C1.2e calculate numbers of protons, neutrons and electrons in atoms and ions, given atomic number and mass number of isotopes
1.2.5.1 definitions of an ion, atomic number, mass number and an isotope
1.2.5.2 the standard notation to represent these
