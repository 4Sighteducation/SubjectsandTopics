         11.2.1.1. Use tables and grids to list the outcomes of single events and simple combinations of events, and to calculate theoretical probabilities.
      11.2.2. Enumeration
         11.2.2.1. Use systematic listing strategies.
      11.2.3. Venn diagrams and sets
         11.2.3.1. Use a two-circle Venn diagram to enumerate sets, and use this to calculate related probabilities.
      11.2.4. Tree diagrams
         11.2.4.1. Use tree diagrams to enumerate sets and to record the probabilities of successive events.
      11.2.5. The addition law of probability
         11.2.5.1. Use the addition law for mutually exclusive events.
      11.2.6. The multiplication law of probability and conditional probability
         11.2.6.1. Use tree diagrams and other representations to calculate the probability of independent and dependent combined events.

12. Statistics
   12.1. Sampling
      12.1.1. Populations and samples
         12.1.1.1. Define the population in a study, and understand the difference between population and sample. Infer properties of populations or distributions from a sample.
   12.2. Interpreting and representing data

         12.2.1.1. Interpret and construct charts appropriate to the data type; including frequency tables, bar charts, pie charts and pictograms for categorical data, vertical line charts for ungrouped discrete numerical data.
      12.2.2. Grouped data
         12.2.2.1. Interpret and construct diagrams for grouped data as appropriate, i.e. cumulative frequency graphs and histograms (with either equal or unequal class intervals).
