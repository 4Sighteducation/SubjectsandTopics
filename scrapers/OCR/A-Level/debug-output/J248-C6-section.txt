Carbon chemistry is the basis of life on Earth. Organic chemistry is the basis of Learners tend not to bring the concepts from general chemistry in their study of
many of the materials we produce. Organic compounds are covalent in nature organic chemistry. They have difficulty identifying functional groups and naming
