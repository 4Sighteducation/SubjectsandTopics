1.1.3 The Portfolio is marked using the relevant marking criteria for the Portfolio in Section 3f.

1.2 Component 02: Externally set task
1.2.1 An early release paper will be issued on 2 January each year.
1.2.2 The paper will provide learners with five themes, each with a range of written and visual starting points and stimuli.
1.2.3 Learners are expected to choose one option for which they will generate an appropriate personal response of one or more artefact(s)/product(s)/personal outcome(s) within a 10-hour supervised time period.
1.2.4 Planning and preparation:
1.2.4.1 The amount of time given to learners for the preparation period should be determined by centres.

1.2.4.3 Guidance should be given to learners about availability and choice of materials, health and safety, avoidance of plagiarism and completion of work in accordance with specification requirements and procedures.
1.2.5 Realising intentions:
1.2.5.1 Learners will have up to 10 hours in which to independently realise their response(s) through the production of one or more artefact(s)/product(s)/personal outcome(s).
1.2.5.2 The 10-hour supervised time period can be divided into a number of sessions and timetabled to suit the centre.
1.2.5.3 All work must be kept securely between sessions.
1.2.5.4 Learners must not do or bring any additional work into any of the supervised sessions.
