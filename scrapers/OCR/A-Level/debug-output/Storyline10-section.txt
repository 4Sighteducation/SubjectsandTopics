Colour by design (CD)
A study of dyes and dyeing and the use of chemistry to ends with reactions of carbonyl compounds, and case
provide colour to order. The storyline begins by looking studies to illustrate the synthesis of organic molecules.
at biological pigments, such as found in carrots, to
examine the origins of colour in delocalised systems The chemical ideas in this module are:

• aromatic compounds and their reactions
The storyline then moves on to synthetic dyes,
including picric acid, chrysodin and mauveine. The • dyes and dyeing
concepts explored in this context includes electrophilic
• diazonium compounds
substitution reactions of benzene, and formation of
diazonium compounds. At this point, the storyline also
• fats and oils
takes a look at the overall structure of dye molecules
and how dyes attach themselves to fibres. • gas–liquid chromatography
• carbonyl compounds and their reactions
Food dyes and food testing then form the context
for studying the structure of fats and oils and the
