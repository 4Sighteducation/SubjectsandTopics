Contents
Proof (a) Proof by induction is introduced for formulae for simple sequences, sums of series and powers of matrices.
Proof (b) Proof by induction is used more generally, including to prove divisibility results
Complex Numbers (a) Complex numbers and their basic arithmetic are introduced, including in modulus-argument form. They are used to solve polynomial
equations with real coefficients and to define loci on the Argand diagram.
Complex Numbers (b) De Moivre’s theorem is used to develop trigonometrical relationships. Roots of complex numbers are used to help to solve geometrical
problems using an Argand diagram.
Matrices and Matrix arithmetic is introduced and applied to linear transformations in 2-D, and some in 3-D. Inverses of matrices (which may be found
transformations (a) using a calculator in the 3 × 3 case) are used to solve matrix equations and related to inverse transformations.
Matrices and The determinant and inverse of a 3 × 3 matrix are found without a calculator.
transformations (b)
Vectors and 3-D space (a) Scalar products are introduced, and used to form the equation of a plane. How planes intersect in 3-D space is considered, and matrices
are used to find the point(s) of intersection.
Vectors and 3-D space (b) Vector equations of lines are studied; methods for finding angles and distances between points, lines and planes are developed.
Algebra (a) Relationships between roots of and coefficients of polynomials are explored.
Series (a) Standard formulae and the method of differences are used to calculate the sum of given series.
Series (b) Partial fractions are used to sum series. Maclaurin series are used to approximate functions.
Calculus (b) Integration techniques are extended to include improper integrals, volumes of revolution, mean values of functions and partial fractions.
Inverse trigonometric functions are defined and used for integration.
Polar Coordinates (b) Curves defined in polar coordinates are explored, including finding the area enclosed by a curve.
Hyperbolic functions (b) Hyperbolic functions and their inverses are used in integration.
Differential equations (b) The work in A level Mathematics is extended to include the integrating factor method for first order differential equations. The general
2nd order linear differential equation is solved; applications include SHM, damped oscillations and paired linear 1st order differential
equations.
