GCSE MATHEMATICS 3
The WJEC Eduqas GCSE in Mathematics provides a broad, coherent, satisfying and
worthwhile course of study. It encourages learners to develop confidence in, and a
positive attitude towards, mathematics and to recognise the importance of
mathematics in their own lives and to society. It also provides a strong mathematical
foundation for learners who go on to study mathematics at a higher level post-16.
This specification enables learners to:
 develop fluent knowledge, skills and understanding of mathematical methods
and concepts
 acquire, select and apply mathematical techniques to solve problems
 reason mathematically, make deductions and inferences and draw
conclusions
 comprehend, interpret and communicate mathematical information in a variety
of forms appropriate to the information and context.
The WJEC Eduqas GCSE in Mathematics places problem solving at the heart of
mathematics learning, which helps learners tackle everyday mathematical problems
whilst studying and after obtaining the qualification.
It encourages the teaching of links between different areas of the curriculum by
targeting questions that cover the content from different subject areas within
mathematics.
This specification is intended to promote a variety of styles of teaching and learning
so that the courses are enjoyable for all participants. It will enable learners to
progress to higher-level courses of mathematical studies. Following this linear
course, learners could benefit from having a greater understanding of the links
between subject areas, in particular graphical and algebraic representation, which
are prevalent throughout A level mathematics.

There are no previous learning requirements for this specification. Any requirements
set for entry to a course based on this specification are at the school/college’s
discretion.
This specification builds on subject content which is typically taught at Key Stage
3 and provides a suitable foundation for the study of mathematics at either AS or
A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile
course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.
This specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to achieve
because they have a particular protected characteristic.
The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.
The specification has been discussed with groups who represent the interests of a
diverse range of learners, and the specification will be kept under review.
Reasonable adjustments are made for certain learners in order to enable them to
access the assessments (e.g. candidates are allowed access to a Sign Language
Interpreter, using British Sign Language). Information on reasonable adjustments is
found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ):
Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments and Special Consideration:
General and Vocational Qualifications.
This document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk). As a consequence
of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will have a complete
barrier to any part of the assessment.

data, i.e. histograms with equal and unequal class intervals and cumulative
frequency graphs, and know their appropriate use
HS5. interpret, analyse and compare the distributions of data sets from univariate
empirical distributions through:
 appropriate graphical representation involving discrete, continuous and
grouped data, including box plots
 appropriate measures of central tendency (median, mean, mode and
modal class) and spread (range, including consideration of outliers,
quartiles and inter-quartile range)
HS6. apply statistics to describe a population
HS7. use and interpret scatter graphs of bivariate data;
recognise correlation and know that it does not indicate causation;
draw estimated lines of best fit;
make predictions;
interpolate and extrapolate apparent trends whilst knowing the dangers of so doing

30% 25%
 assess the validity of an argument and critically
evaluate a given way of presenting information
Where problems require learners to ‘use and apply
standard techniques’ or to independently ‘solve problems’
a proportion of those marks should be attributed to the
corresponding assessment objective.
AO3
Solve problems within mathematics and in other
contexts

30% 25%
 evaluate methods used and results obtained
 evaluate solutions to identify how they may have been
affected by assumptions made
Where problems require learners to ‘use and apply
standard techniques’ or to ‘reason, interpret and
communicate mathematically’ a proportion of those marks
should be attributed to the corresponding assessment
objective.

This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the
course. Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer and November
series each year, until the end of the life of this specification. Summer 2017 will be
the first assessment opportunity.
A qualification may be taken more than once. Candidates must resit all examination
components in the same series.
Candidates who take an assessment in the November series must have reached at
least the age of 16 on or before 31 August in the same calendar year as the
assessment.
The entry code appears below.
WJEC Eduqas GCSE Mathematics (foundation tier): C300PF
WJEC Eduqas GCSE Mathematics (higher tier): C300PH
The current edition of our Entry Procedures and Coding Information gives up-to-date
entry procedures.
GCSE qualifications are reported on a nine point scale from 1 to 9, where 9 is the
highest grade.
A learner who takes higher tier assessments will be awarded a grade within the
range of 4 to 9, or be unclassified. However, if the mark achieved by such a learner
is a small number of marks below the 3/4 grade boundary that learner may be
awarded a grade 3.
A learner who takes foundation tier assessments will be awarded a grade within the
range of 1 to 5, or be unclassified.
