subject content which is typically taught at key stage 3
and provides a suitable foundation for the study of English literature at either AS or
A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile
course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.
This specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to achieve
because they have a particular protected characteristic.
The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.
The specification has been discussed with groups who represent the interests of a
diverse range of learners, and the specification will be kept under review.
Reasonable adjustments are made for certain learners in order to enable them to
access the assessments (e.g. application for extra time in a GCSE subject where
extended writing is required). Information on reasonable adjustments is found in the
following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access
Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments and Special Consideration: General and
Vocational Qualifications.
This document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk). As a consequence
of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will have a complete
barrier to any part of the assessment.

GCSE ENGLISH LITERATURE 5
The qualification is made up of two externally-assessed components: Component 1 and
Component 2. Both components allow learners to show their depth and breadth of
knowledge through varied assessments.
This specification contains the full range of content for GCSE English literature as set
out by the Department for Education. Centres may, however, use any flexibility to
increase depth, breadth or context within the specified topics or to consolidate
teaching of the subject content. This specification has been designed on the basis
that learners’ reading should be of whole texts.
Scope of study
Reading comprehension and reading critically
• literal and inferential comprehension: understanding a word, phrase or sentence
in context; exploring aspects of plot, characterisation, events and settings;
distinguishing between what is stated explicitly and what is implied; explaining
motivation, sequence of events, and the relationship between actions or events
• critical reading: identifying the theme and distinguishing between themes;
supporting a point of view by referring to evidence in the text; recognising the
possibility of and evaluating different responses to a text; using understanding of
writers’ social, historical and cultural contexts to inform evaluation; making an
informed personal response that derives from analysis and evaluation of the text
• evaluation of a writer’s choice of vocabulary, grammatical and structural features:
analysing and evaluating how language (including figurative language), structure,
form and presentation contribute to quality and impact; using linguistic and literary
terminology for such evaluation (such as, but not restricted to, phrase, metaphor,
meter, irony and persona, synecdoche, pathetic fallacy)
• comparing texts: comparing and contrasting texts studied, referring where
relevant to theme, characterisation, context (where known), style and literary
quality; comparing two texts critically with respect to the above.
Writing
• producing clear and coherent text: writing effectively about literature for a range
of purposes such as: to describe, explain, summarise, argue, analyse and
evaluate; discussing and maintaining a point of view; selecting and emphasising
key points; using relevant quotation and using detailed textual references
• accurate Standard English: accurate spelling, punctuation and grammar.
In addition, learners are required to study the following content:
• at least one play by Shakespeare
• at least one 19th century novel
• a selectionof poetry since 1789, including representative Romantic poetry
• fiction or drama from the British Isles from 1914 onwards.
