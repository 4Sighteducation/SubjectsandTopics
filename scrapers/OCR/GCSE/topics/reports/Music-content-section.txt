Introduction
This specification enables learners to develop knowledge and understanding of
music through four interrelated areas of study:
Area of study 1: Musical Forms and Devices
Area of study 2: Music for Ensemble
Area of study 3: Film Music
Area of study 4: Popular Music.
The specification has three components based on the three skills of performing,
composing and appraising. An integrated approach to the three skills is
encouraged through each area of study and serves to highlight the importance of the
relationship between composer, performer and audience.
Knowledge and understanding of each area of study is assessed explicitly in
Component 3. However, learners are also required to perform and compose music
using conventions, styles or idioms linked to at least one area of study. Learners may
choose the same or different areas of study for Components 1 and 2. Learners will
also have the opportunity to follow their own musical interests in composition and
performance.
The following information provides an introduction to each area of study. Sections 2.1
to 2.3 of this specification provide details of each component.
Area of study 1: Musical Forms and Devices
Forms and devices are of fundamental importance in musical composition, and many
of the common musical forms and devices used by composers today have their origin
in the Western Classical Tradition. The music of the Baroque, Classical and
Romantic eras provides the context for a study of binary, ternary, minuet and trio
rondo, variation and strophic forms. Learners are encouraged to engage with a
variety of music from the prescribed eras, through a range of performing, composing
and appraising activities. They are also encouraged to make links between music
they listen to, pieces they perform and their own compositions, as well as music by
composers from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries who use these forms and
devices.
Area of study 2: Music for Ensemble
Music for ensemble forms the basis for a study of texture and sonority. Through a
study of diverse musical styles composed for ensemble, such as jazz and blues,
musical theatre and chamber music, learners will consider how music is composed
for small groups of instruments and voices. Learners will also consider how texture is
manipulated and they are encouraged to use small instrumental/vocal groupings in
their own music. Learners are required to perform as part of an ensemble, and
through this to actively engage with ensemble music, understanding the relationship
between performers on the stage and the audience.

GCSE MUSIC 6
Area of study 3: Film Music
The film industry is of considerable commercial and cultural interest in both the UK
and abroad. There are many areas of specialism for musicians within this industry
such as composer, orchestrator, arranger, performer, music editor, producer and
more. A film composer scores music to accompany a motion picture for film or
television. This includes dramatic underscore and thematic music as well as popular
songwriting. Through this area of study learners are encouraged to consider how
music for film is created, developed and performed, and the impact this has on the
audience. Learners will have the opportunity to compose and perform film music and
are encouraged to use musical technology to create mood and atmosphere through
engaging with the story of the film.
Area of study 4: Popular Music
Popular music is a wide-ranging and diverse art form encompassing several distinct
genres. The popular music industry offers a wide range of opportunities for both
composers and performers, including singer, song-writer, music producer, arranger
and more. Through this area of study learners are encouraged to explore the musical
idioms associated with a variety of popular music, and they will have the opportunity
to perform popular music as well as compose music associated with a popular music
genre. Learners are also encouraged to use music technology, understanding the
impact this has on the way music is developed and performed in popular music.

GCSE MUSIC 7
2.1 Component 1
Performing
Total duration of performances: 4-6 minutes
Non-exam assessment: internally assessed, externally moderated
30% of qualification
72 marks
Learners are encouraged to develop their knowledge and understanding of music
through performing. All learners are required to perform a minimum of two pieces of
which at least one must be as part of an ensemble performance lasting at least one
minute. The other piece(s) may be performed either solo and/or as part of an
ensemble. One piece must be linked to one of the four areas of study. The use of
music technology and improvisation is accepted within both solo and ensemble
performances.
Selecting Music for Performance
The standard of pieces selected for performance should be broadly equivalent to
grade 3 of the graded music examinations. Appendix A contains descriptions of the
levels of difficulty for vocal performances (including rapping, MC-ing and beat-
boxing), instrumental performances and technology-based performances. This
guidance must be followed when playing pieces not listed for graded music
examinations.
One of the pieces performed must be linked to specific aspects of musical content
within one of the four areas of study. All learners are required to perform one
ensemble piece and when this is linked to area of study 2, Music for Ensemble, the
piece must be related to one of the specific genres or styles covered in this area of
study.
Area of study 1: Musical Forms and Devices
Area of study 2: Music for Ensemble
Area of study 3: Film Music
Area of study 4: Popular Music
Examples of performances linked to an area of study are noted below.
1. Musical Forms and Devices
• A performance of a piece composed either during the Baroque, Classical or
Romantic eras
• A performance of a piece written in either binary, ternary, rondo, variation or
strophic forms
A performance of a piece of music which makes a feature of a compositional device
2. Music for Ensemble
• A performance of a piece of ensemble music in either the chamber music
tradition, or musical theatre tradition or the jazz and blues tradition
3. Film Music
• A performance of a piece of music used in a film or composed specifically for
a film
4. Popular Music
• A performance of any genre of popular music

GCSE MUSIC 8
Learners may choose to perform one of their own compositions. Learners must
ensure that the composition allows them the opportunity to demonstrate their highest
performing skills.
Learners are not restricted to one instrument/voice. However, there is no advantage
in performing on more than one instrument. A copy of the music for all pieces must
be provided for the assessor. Where this is impossible due to the nature of the
performance, e.g. DJ-ing, a detailed and accurate lead sheet must be provided.
Ensemble Performance
All learners are required to perform as part of an ensemble. An ensemble
performance may be on any instrument, voice or technology-based option. In each
case learners are required to:
• perform in a group of between two and eight live performers, the other members
of the ensemble need not be taking the examination
• perform a significant individual part which is not doubled
• perform accompanied or unaccompanied as a group but not conducted (the
accompaniment can be live or a backing track).
Lieder accompaniment (or similar skill) is an acceptable ensemble, when the learner
is the accompanist but not when the learner is the soloist.
Please see the Guidance for Teaching document for further clarification of ensemble
requirements.
Where there is an element of doubt concerning the ensemble, please contact WJEC
for advice.
Solo Performance
Learners may choose to perform a solo. Solos may be either accompanied or
unaccompanied. The accompaniment can be live or a backing track. The
accompanist need not be taking the examination.
Improvisation
Learners may choose to prepare an improvisation to a stimulus of their own choice
for a solo performance or as part of an ensemble. This may be prepared in advance
of the practical assessment. (A stimulus may be a chord sequence, a scale etc.) A
copy of the musical stimulus must be provided for the assessor.
Technology-based Performance
Learners may choose to offer a technology-based realisation as part of an ensemble
or a solo performance. Technology-based performances include DJ-ing and
sequencing and other appropriate technology-based formats. If in any doubt as to
whether the form chosen is appropriate, please contact WJEC for advice.

GCSE MUSIC 9
Assessment of Component 1
Learners may perform at any time during the academic year in which the assessment
is to be taken. Learners do not have to perform all pieces on the same day. The
performance must be recorded with the teacher present, so that the work can be
authenticated. In all performances, learners will be expected to display:
• technical control
• expression and appropriate interpretation
• accuracy of rhythm and pitch
• appropriate pace and fluency
• effective use of dynamics
• stylistic awareness
• empathy (in ensemble playing).
Portfolio evidence
Portfolio evidence for the moderation sample must be submitted online via WJEC's
website. Please note, the performance recording must be in mp3 format to reduce file
size (maximum individual file size is limited to 20MB). All portfolios must contain the
items listed below.
1. Recordings of performances.
2. A score or a lead sheet outlining the melody, chords, tempo and performance
directions.
3. An authentication form with the details of the performance, including titles and
difficulty levels of all pieces performed, signed by both the teacher and the
candidate. An electronic signature is acceptable. Please use the form
provided on the WJEC website.
