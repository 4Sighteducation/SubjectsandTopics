SUBJECT CONTENT
This GCSE specification requires learners to:
 study the content in a UK context except where otherwise stated
 study, critically evaluate and compare and contrast theories or explanations,
including the key features of each theory or explanation in the context of the
specific area of sociology.
In Component 1, learners will consider how human beings acquire their identity and
examine the process of passing on culture from generation to generation and in
diverse settings. Learners will be encouraged to contemplate how they acquire their
individual identity. This theme is continued through a detailed study of two agents of
socialisation: families and education, which will provide learners with a deeper, more
theoretical understanding of the social world and an awareness that the process of
socialisation is contested.
Concepts and theories used throughout Component 1 will be applied to an
understanding and analysis of the topic areas in Component 2.
In Component 2, learners will enhance their awareness of the social world through
an examination of social structures and their influence on human behaviour.
Learners will also develop an understanding of the nature and extent of inequality
and will examine competing theories on the causes of inequality through a study of
the ideas of the classical sociologists, and a more detailed study of crime and
deviance.
In applied methods of sociological enquiry, learners are encouraged to develop their
understanding of the research process by studying the stages in carrying out
research and in interpreting data. This will assist in their assessment of the evidence
used in both components.
Skills
Both components require learners to demonstrate essential skills developed through
their study of sociology; that is, the ability to show their knowledge and
understanding of key concepts and issues in the context of sociological theory and
methodology. Learners are also expected to select, interpret, evaluate and apply
their knowledge and understanding in a range of theoretical and practical contexts.
Learners will also be expected to apply and evaluate this knowledge and
understanding to a range of related methodological issues.
This specification requires learners to:
 draw on information and evidence from different sources and demonstrate the
ability to synthesise them
 analyse and evaluate different research methods used in sociological
investigations and assess, critically, the appropriateness of their use
 analyse and evaluate information and evidence presented in different written,
visual and numerical forms
 apply their understanding to explore and debate the current sociological issues
outlined in each of the topic areas
 use sociological theories and evidence to compare and contrast social issues,
construct reasoned arguments and debates, make substantiated judgement and
to draw conclusions
 draw connections between the different topic areas studied.

GCSE SOCIOLOGY 6
In addition, the specification requires learners to:
 demonstrate knowledge and understanding of key sociological theories by
reading and responding to extracts which illustrate the different views of
sociologists regarding the topics which have been studied. Students should
be able to critically analyse and evaluate how the issues have been
interpreted by these sociologists.
2.1 Component 1
Component 1: Understanding Social Processes
Written examination: 1 hour 45 minutes
50% of qualification
100 marks
This component focuses on the themes of socialisation, identity and culture. Learners
study the key concepts and processes of cultural transmission, including socialisation
and the acquisition of identity, and develop these through detailed study of families
and education.
Sociological research methods are presented as a separate topic area. However,
research methods should permeate the entire course. Learners should be
encouraged, when considering the evidence used to support or challenge theories in
their study of families and education, to examine the research methods used, their
reliability and their appropriateness for that study. This will help learners to understand
the importance of assessing the research methods used in evidence gathering.
Sociological theory and its relevance in contemporary society also permeates the
course. Learners should be familiar with the theories of named classical sociologists
and their relevance to contemporary society.
All theories and studies are to be considered in a UK context except where otherwise
stated.

2.2 Component 2

The focus in this component is on social differentiation, power and stratification. This
includes the theme of power, issues of social order and social control, studied
through crime and deviance. Learners also study applied methods of sociological
enquiry.
Learners’ knowledge and understanding of sociological research methods studied in
Component 1 will be reinforced by considering the research methods used to gather
evidence for the theories studied in Component 2.
In applied methods of social enquiry, learners are encouraged to further develop their
understanding of the research process by considering the stages in carrying out
research and in interpreting data. This will assist them in their assessment of the
evidence used to support or challenge theories in both components.
