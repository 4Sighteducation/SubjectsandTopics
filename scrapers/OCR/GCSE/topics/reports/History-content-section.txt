SUBJECT CONTENT
This specification provides a broad and coherent course of study. The specification
ensures the study of:
• history on three different timescales; short, medium and long-term
• history in three geographical contexts; local, British and European/ World
• history across three historical eras.
The breadth of the specification is, therefore, ensured by the features above.
This specification also provides a coherent and integrated study of history by fulfilling
the agreed subject content. This specification offers an opportunity for teachers of
history to approach the subject through a variety of options which will lead to a broad,
balanced and coherent course. All permitted combinations of study provided by this
specification allow centres to construct a course which is broad and coherent for
learners. Each component offers a different perspective to the study of history and
ensures breadth and coherence.
This specification will develop in learners the ability to construct balanced, reasoned
and well substantiated extended responses to historical questions. This specification
and its assessment provides opportunities for extended responses which allow
learners to demonstrate the ability to construct and develop a sustained line of
reasoning which is coherent, relevant, substantiated and logically structured.
This specification will also develop in learners the ability to create written narratives
in which they demonstrate chronological grasp, the ability to organise their historical
knowledge and understanding, order points, make connections and explain
consequences.
Component 1: Studies in Depth
Written examinations: 2 hours (comprising two papers of 1 hour duration each)
50% of qualification
100 marks (plus 6 marks for spelling, punctuation and grammar and use of specialist
terms)
Learners study two Studies in Depth, one British and one non-British, from eight
options in total. This component focuses study on substantial and coherent short time
scales. Studies in Depth will provide learners with the opportunity to study history in
greater depth and consequently understand the complexity of a society or historical
situation more effectively. Studies in Depth will focus study on different historical eras
and different geographical contexts. This component encourages learners to use a
wide range of historical sources. Learners should also study different historical
interpretations of specific events and issues.

GCSE HISTORY 7
Component 2: Studies in Breadth
Written examinations: 2 hours (comprising two papers of 45 minutes for the Period
Study and one hour fifteen minutes for the Thematic Study)
50% of qualification
100 marks (plus 4 marks for spelling, punctuation and grammar and use of specialist
terms)
Learners study one Period Study and one Thematic Study, from eight options in
total. This component focuses study on substantial and coherent medium and long
timescales. Studies in Breadth will provide learners with the opportunity to study
history over longer timescales and consequently understand the changing nature of
developments and issues associated with particular periods and geographical
contexts. Studies in Breadth will also allow learners to understand change and
continuity and similarity and difference across long sweeps of history, as well as the
most significant characteristics of different ages. Studies in Breadth will focus study
on different historical eras and different geographical contexts. This component
encourages learners to develop an understanding of second order historical concepts
in particular, including continuity, change, cause, consequence, significance and
similarity and difference.
Study of the historic environment
The requirement to study the historic environment should focus on one particular site
in its historical context. Learners should examine the relationship between a place
and historical events and developments. In this specification the study of the historic
environment is an integrated part of the required content for each of the Thematic
Studies. The following provides guidance on how centres should approach the study
of an historic site.
The investigation of an historic site offers learners the opportunity to actively engage
in the past. In doing so they will:
• develop their knowledge and understanding of an historic site
• ask relevant questions about an historic site and investigate them critically
• organise and communicate their knowledge and understanding of an historic site
in order to reach substantiated judgements.
In studying an historic site, learners should consider the following:
• the key historic features of the historic site
• the significance of the historic site on a local, regional or national level
• the relevance of the historic site to the development of the chosen Thematic
Study
• how the historic site contributes to a broader understanding of changes in the
history of the chosen Thematic Study.

GCSE HISTORY 8
For each Thematic Study an historic site will be nominated which will emerge
naturally from the required content. The nominated historic site for each Thematic
Study will change every two years (see table below). The study of the historic
environment is worth 10% of the overall specification. There is no requirement that
learners visit the site.
