SUBJECT CONTENT
This qualification is devised in accordance with the subject content laid down by the
Department for Education and the technical guidance from Ofqual. It consists of two
compulsory components (Components 1 and 2) and one further component from a
choice of two (Components 3A and 3B).
2.1 Component 1
Latin Language
Written examination: 1 hour 30 minutes
50% of the qualification
100 marks
In this component learners should be able to:
● recognise and use the accidence and syntax listed in Appendix B
● show knowledge of and make accurate use of the vocabulary in the Latin-English
Defined Vocabulary List (DVL)
● translate a passage of Latin prose (confected or adapted) into English accurately
● comprehend a passage of Latin and answer questions in English on it
● demonstrate knowledge of the derivation links between Latin and English
● translate short sentences from English into Latin using the prescribed DVL and
the prescribed syntax and accidence
OR
● recognise, analyse and explain the prescribed syntax and accidence (as listed in
Appendix B) within a short passage of Latin.
This component consists of two compulsory sections, in which learners respond to
unseen material.
Section A: this takes the form of a momentum test consisting of a narrative in Latin
divided into three passages. There are comprehension questions on parts one and
three (totalling 55% of the marks for this paper), and the middle part is to be
translated into English (35%). There is an incline of difficulty between parts one and
three and within the passage to be translated.
There is a Defined Vocabulary List of 440 words in Appendix A. Any other words
appearing in the narrative will be glossed. A set of grammatical structures with which
learners are expected to be familiar is given in Appendix B.
Section A accounts for 90% of the marks in this component.
Section B: this offers the choice between:
• a translation from English into Latin of a small number of simple (single-
clause) sentences. The vocabulary and accidence required for this option are
given in Appendix A and Appendix B.
• the recognition, analysis and explanation of syntax and accidence within a
short passage of Latin. The grammatical structures required for this option are
given in Appendix B.
Section B accounts for 10% of the marks in this component.

extended evaluative question.
Each theme, comprising both prose and verse, is accompanied by a selection of
prescribed ancient source materials (e.g. paintings, mosaics, sculptures, buildings,
graffiti) on which one or more questions will be asked.
There will be a choice of two themes in any session.

all the prescribed material can be found on the WJEC Eduqas website.
This is an open-book examination (i.e. in the examination room learners will be
provided with a clean copy of the resource booklet by WJEC).
At least one question demands an extended evaluative response using material from
across the chosen theme. In their extended responses, learners should demonstrate
their ability to construct and develop a sustained line of reasoning which is coherent
