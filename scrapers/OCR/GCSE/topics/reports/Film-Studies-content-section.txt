Overview
The WJEC Eduqas specification in GCSE Film Studies starts with individuals'
excitement about a powerful audio-visual medium, which is central to today's society
and culture. The films learners study are designed to exploit that enthusiasm and
motivate them to broaden their knowledge of film and film technology from the first
moving images introduced to audiences in 1895 to the digital environment of
contemporary film.
Production work is a central part of this specification. Learners will therefore be
given the opportunity to create their own film or screenplay through producing genre-
based extracts. This will enable them to apply all that they have learnt about film to
filmmaking or screenwriting as well as provide learners with a fresh, filmmaking
perspective on the films studied.
The films learners study will introduce them to a broad range of films from around the
world as well as give them a historical perspective on film. The US films they focus
on, for example, will include mainstream films from the past – films produced in the
1950s and late 1970s and 80s, two distinct phases of Hollywood's development.
Through comparing these films, learners will see how genres change, how the
contexts in which films are produced affect films and how elements such as
cinematography and editing change and develop. More recent US film will be
explored through independent productions – films produced outside the mainstream,
which have allowed their filmmakers to explore less conventional topics and issues.
Although many learners' experience of cinema is likely to be dominated by US film –
well over 80% of the films shown in UK mainstream cinemas are American – this
specification offers the chance to explore film produced outside the US – in Europe,
including the UK, South Africa and Australia.
This WJEC Eduqas specification will enable learners to explore films in a coherent
way, cumulatively developing their knowledge and understanding of:
• how films are constructed – through cinematography (camerawork and lighting),
mise-en-scène (how sets, locations, props and costume are used in film), editing
and sound
• how films are organised into structures – genre (the different kinds of film) and
narrative (how films tell their stories)
• how films can be used – artistically (the aesthetic qualities of film) and as a way
of communicating ideas and issues (representation)
• how learners make sense of film through exploring a film's relevant contexts
(social, cultural, historical, political and institutional), through an awareness of key
aspects of the history of film and through specialist writing on film.

GCSE FILM STUDIES 8
This learning progression - from the key elements of film form to recognising how
contexts and writing on film can deepen understanding – will be explored in this
specification across a range of films. Two core study areas will be studied in relation
to all films:
• the key elements of film form (cinematography, mise-en-scène, editing and
sound)
• the contexts of film (social, cultural, historical, technological, institutional and,
where relevant, political).
Some films will have an additional focus beyond these core study areas:
• the global English language film will focus additionally on narrative
• the global non-English language film will focus additionally on
representation
• the contemporary UK film will focus additionally on a film's aesthetic
qualities – its style
• the US independent film will be studied in relation to specialist writing on film
set by WJEC in order to enable students to deepen their understanding of film
• the comparison of two US films from the past will be studied in a holistic
way but will focus on comparing the films in terms of genre, narrative and
context.
Studying film: core study areas
Learners will study each of their six films using the following core study areas:
1. Key elements of film form (cinematography, mise-en-scène, editing and sound)
2. The contexts of film (social, cultural, historical, political, and institutional),
including key aspects of the history of film and film technology.
1. Key elements of film form
Film can be explored through its detail (for example, through the technical elements
such as individual shots, locations, sound or editing, which are all used to make a
film) or through the ways these are organised into larger structures (genre and
narrative). The formal way of describing these technical elements is cinematography
(which includes lighting), mise-en-scène, editing and sound. In this specification,
these are termed the key elements of film form. The ability to analyse how these key
elements of film form create meaning – both in isolation and together – is a core skill
in Film Studies at all levels.
Learners will need to understand the following aspects of cinematography, mise-en-
scène, editing and sound and be able to explore them in relation to the films they
study:

scène
• how mise-en-scène conventionally conveys realism
• how settings contribute to the themes and issues a film raises
• how props contribute to character and/or narrative development in the films
studied
• how costume and make-up convey character
• how each of the above aspects of mise-en-scène generates spectator responses
Editing
• types of edit (cut, dissolve, fade)
• the principles of continuity editing (shot-reverse shot)
• cross-cutting
• pace of editing
• visual effects (created in post-production)
• the typical meanings associated with all of the above aspects of editing
• how continuity editing establishes relationships between characters
• how cross-cutting contributes to the portrayal of character
• how editing contributes to narrative development in the films studied
• how editing, including visual effects, generates spectator responses
Sound
• diegetic and non-diegetic sound, including ambient sound, sound effects and
sound bridges
• the typical meanings associated with diegetic sound including how it contributes
to character and narrative development
• the typical meanings associated with non-diegetic sound including how music
motifs convey character and different types of music contribute to the narrative
• how non-diegetic sound in particular contributes to the themes and issues a film
raises
• how sound, particularly music, whether diegetic or non-diegetic, generates
spectator responses in the films studied.

2. The contexts of film
A film is influenced by the various contexts in which it is produced. Films reflect and
respond to the social, cultural, political, technological and institutional contexts in
which they are made, whether that is the present or the past (the historical context).
Apart from institutional and technological contexts, it is a film's narrative which most
obviously reflects a film's contexts. When films are set in the past, such as Singin' in
the Rain, Grease and Dracula in this specification, learners should focus on the
contexts of the narrative (when the film is set). Relating their chosen films to the
history of film and film technology is a further important context learners need to
consider.
Learners will thus need to study how their chosen films reflect the contexts in which
they are made. This includes study of the:
• social context (aspects of society and its structure reflected in the film)
• cultural context (aspects of culture – ways of living, beliefs and values of groups
of people – reflected in the film)
• historical context (aspects of the society and culture at the time when films are
made and, where relevant, when they are set)
• political context (the way political issues, when relevant to the film chosen, are
reflected in a film)
• technological context (the technologies reflected in a film's production and, in
some cases, in its narrative)
• institutional context (how films are funded, how the level of production budget
affects the kind of film made and the main stages of film production)
• key aspects of the history of film and film technology (as noted below).
Learners will need to be introduced to the most significant developments in the
history of film and film technology, which will include at least the following:
• the first moving images and silent film
• the rise of Hollywood and the development of sound
• the introduction of colour film
• the emergence of widescreen technology and 3D film
• the development of portable cameras and Steadicam technology
• the role of computer-generated imagery in film.
See Appendix B for a timeline of key developments in film and film technology.
Studying film: additional study areas
Four additional film study areas will provide the focus for the study of:
3. Narrative (structural element of film form): global English language film
4. Representation of people and ideas: global non-English language film
5. Film style – the aesthetic qualities of film: contemporary UK film
6. Specialist writing on film, including film criticism: US independent film
3. Narrative (structural element of film form): global English language film
The way the key elements of film form are organised into larger structures, genre and
narrative, involves studying films as a whole. Whilst genre will be studied in relation
to the US film comparative study, narrative will be studied as a focus area in relation
to global English language film. Learners will also need to understand how
narratives are constructed and be able to recognise the role of the screenplay in
establishing the main features of a film's narrative as indicated below:

GCSE FILM STUDIES 11
• the distinction between plot and story
• the role of the screenplay in conveying plot and its realisation in visual terms
• cause and effect as a structural principle of narrative
• narrative techniques including ellipsis and withholding/releasing
• narrative conventions in screenwriting including three act structure, plot points,
inciting incident and climax
• an interpretation of the narrative
• the role of character and character function in narrative
• how all of the above bullet points contribute to narrative development
• the themes and issues raised by narrative
• how narrative generates spectator responses.
4. Representation of people and ideas: global non-English language film
The images which form the basis of film are never simply 'pictures of reality' but
always provide points of view about what they portray. This is the root of the study of
representation and learners will need to study the significance of different
representations within the films they study. They will need to explore how their
chosen films represent, and thus offer particular perspectives on, gender, ethnicity,
age and different cultures.
5. Film style – the aesthetic qualities of film: contemporary UK film
Although it is not always emphasised, film is an art form. The study of a film's
aesthetic qualities, therefore, involves considering how all aspects of film form are
combined artistically. In exploring the aesthetic qualities of film, learners may
consider, for example, individual shots, their composition and mise-en-scène in
general. In some cases, these elements are used throughout a film and create a
distinctive 'look' or style. Whether aesthetic effects are momentary or whether there
is a distinct aesthetic look to a whole film, learners will be considering where the
'spectacle' of film engages spectators more than a film's narrative.
Learners will need to develop knowledge and understanding of:
• the aesthetic qualities of film
• their significance
• how filmmakers create aesthetic effects through specific film sequences.
6. Specialist writing on film, including film criticism: US independent film
In order to develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of film, learners
are required to study specialist writing on film, including film criticism. This specialist
writing will be studied specifically in relation to US independent film and will be set by
WJEC. It will consist of:
• one source on cinematography
• one source on US independent film
• one film review (one review will be set on each of the five independent films
set by WJEC).
A list of the set specialist writing to support learners' study of their chosen US
independent film is available on the Eduqas GCSE Film Studies website. See
