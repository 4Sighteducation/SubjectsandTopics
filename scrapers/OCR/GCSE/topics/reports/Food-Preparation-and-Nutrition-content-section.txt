1. Food commodities
The range of foods and ingredients to be studied throughout the course should come
from the major commodity groups (as shown below) and reflect current recommended
guidelines for a healthy diet, e.g. reduction of sugar intake.
• bread, cereals, flour, oats, rice, potatoes, pasta
• fruit and vegetables (fresh, frozen, dried, canned and juiced)
• milk, cheese and yoghurt
• meat, fish, poultry, eggs
• soya, tofu, beans, nuts, seeds
• butter, oils, margarine, sugar and syrup
For each food commodity learners need to know and understand:
• the value of the commodity within in the diet
• features and characteristics of each commodity with reference to their correct
storage to avoid food contamination
• the working characteristics of each commodity, with reference to the skill group and
techniques table listed in Appendix A, e.g. when subjected to dry/moist methods of
cooking
• the origins of each commodity
For each food commodity learners need to be able to:
• experiment with the commodity to explore physical and chemical changes that
occur as a result of given actions
• consider complementary actions of a commodity in a recipe
• prepare and cook dishes using the commodities

(i) protein: to include essential amino–acids in relation
to nutritional requirements (histidine, isoleucine,
lysine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine,
tryptophan, valine) and non-essential (alanine,
asparagine, aspartic acid glutamic acid)

and polysaccharides
Micronutrients are required by humans throughout life in
small quantities to facilitate a range of physiological
functions

acid (folate) and vitamin C
(ii) minerals: calcium, iron, potassium and magnesium
(iii) trace elements, to include: iodine and fluoride
Learners must know and understand for each named macro
nutrient and micronutrient:

cooking affects the sensory and nutritional properties of
food. To include:

convection and radiation and how and why the production
of some dishes rely on more than one method of heat
transference
• how selection of appropriate cooking methods can:
(i) conserve or modify nutritive value, e.g. steaming of
green vegetables
(ii) improve palatability e.g. physical denaturation of
protein
• the positive use of micro-organisms such as bacteria in
dairy products: cheese, yoghurt; meat products: salami,
chorizo and fermentation of sugar in drinks
Learners need to undertake experimental work and produce
dishes by following or modifying recipes to develop and apply
knowledge and understanding related to:
• the working characteristics, functional and chemical
properties of ingredients to achieve a particular result:
(i) carbohydrates – gelatinisation, dextrinization
(ii) fats/oils – shortening, aeration, plasticity and
emulsification
(iii) protein – coagulation, foam formation, gluten
formation, denaturation (physical, heat and acid)
(iv) fruit/vegetables – enzymic browning, oxidisation
• reasons why particular results may not always be
achieved, e.g. a sponge cake sinks, a sauce goes lumpy
• how to remedy situations when desired results may not
be achieved in the first instance

Learners should have a theoretical and practical working knowledge
and understanding of the development of culinary traditions in
British and international cuisine.
All learners should have the opportunity to explore and gain
knowledge of foods and recipes from at least two international
countries (these countries are at the discretion of the centre and
do not have to significantly differ from the UK.) To include:
• the distinctive features, characteristics and eating patterns of
different cuisines. Cuisine is defined as a style characteristic
of a particular country or region, where the cuisine has
developed historically using distinctive ingredients, specific
preparation and cooking methods or equipment, and
presentation or serving techniques.
• traditional and modern variations of recipes to include
variations of recipes to include changing use of food
commodities, changes to nutritional guidelines, and use of
modern cooking methods and or equipment

of origin, the transporting, cleaning and sorting of the raw
food e.g. bags of fruit.
• secondary stages of processing and production to include
how primary products are changed into other types of
products, e.g. wheat to bread; milk to cheese and yoghurt;
fruit to jams, jellies and juices.
• how processing affects the sensory and nutritional properties
of ingredients e.g. cured meat products
• technological developments that claim to support better
health and food production including fortification and modified
foods
