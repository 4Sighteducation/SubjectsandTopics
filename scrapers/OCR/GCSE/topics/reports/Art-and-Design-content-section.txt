SUBJECT CONTENT
Introduction
The WJEC Eduqas GCSE Art and Design is conceived as a two year linear qualification. It
consists of two components: Component 1, the Portfolio (60% of qualification, internally
assessed, externally moderated) and Component 2, the Externally Set Assignment (40% of
qualification, internally assessed, externally moderated).
This specification provides the flexibility and capacity to build and extend the breadth and depth
of students’ creative practice and offers the choice of a broad-based general course, plus six
distinct title options with no prohibited entry combinations.
In keeping with the regulatory requirements for all GCSE Art and Design specifications, the
WJEC Eduqas specification requires students to learn through practical experience and
demonstrate knowledge and understanding of sources that inform their creative intentions.
Intentions should be realised through purposeful engagement with visual language, visual
concepts, media, materials and the application of appropriate techniques and working
methods. Practical and theoretical activities should be complementary.
Students are required to develop and apply relevant subject-specific skills in order to use visual
language to communicate personal ideas, meanings and responses. They must, over time,
reflect critically upon their creative journey and its effectiveness in relation to the realisation of
their personal intentions. Their extended responses should be of sufficient length to allow
them to demonstrate their ability to develop a sustained line of reasoning which is relevant,
well evidenced and coherent, drawing together different areas of knowledge, skills and
understanding from across the course.
Students can work entirely in digital media or entirely in non-digital media, or in a mixture of
both, provided the aims and assessment objectives are met.
Component 1, the Portfolio, provides opportunities for students to explore and cultivate
important skills, knowledge and understanding through a variety of experiences. These may
include using resources (such as the local environment, gallery visits, workshops or other
sources) to carry out focused research which supports purposeful developments. During the
course, students should be encouraged to experiment, collaborate, make informed creative
decisions and innovate. Careful consideration of the selection and presentation of their work
should also be encouraged. The primary purpose of this course is to develop a confident
approach that will support students’ creative journeys in the latter part of Component 1 and
throughout Component 2 and beyond.
In alignment with the requirements of the DfE Subject Content for Art and Design, there is also
an emphasis on the value of drawing skills in this specification. All GCSE Art and Design
specifications require students to ‘use drawing skills for different needs and purposes,
appropriate to the context’. However, it is important that the context of this requirement is
recognised. The following excerpt of the DfE subject content provides helpful clarification and
reassurance for teachers and students:
All students must use drawing to support the development process within each chosen area of
study. Students are not required to demonstrate technical mastery of drawing skills unless this
is relevant to their area of study.

GCSE ART AND DESIGN 7
Thus ‘technical mastery’ does not necessarily entail accurate, highly skilful observational
drawing. Rather it highlights the need for students to develop competence in forms of drawing
that are appropriate to the discipline/title which they are studying. This focus should encourage
students to appreciate the significance of drawing in the widest sense, by recognising and
reviewing how it informs the creative process.
(For further explanation of this requirement and more guidance and information on the
definitions and purposes of drawing, refer to Appendix A of this specification.)
Knowledge and understanding
This specification requires students to demonstrate the knowledge and understanding
listed below through the practical application of skills to realise personal intentions relevant
to their chosen title(s) and related area(s) of study. Students are required to know and
understand how sources inspire the development of ideas, for example, drawing on:
• the work and approaches of artists, craftspeople or designers from contemporary
and/or historical contexts, periods, societies and cultures
• contemporary and/or historical environments, situations or issues
• other relevant sources researched by the student in the chosen qualification title and
area(s) of study
• the ways in which meanings, ideas and intentions can be communicated through visual
and tactile language, using formal elements, including colour, line, form, tone and
texture
• the characteristics, properties and effects of using different media, materials,
techniques and processes, and the ways in which they can be used in relation to
students’ own creative intentions and chosen area(s) of study
• the different purposes, intentions and functions of art, craft and design in a variety of
contexts and as appropriate to students’ own work.
In this specification, visual language is defined as including formal elements, media,
materials, tools, processes and technology, as well as the various methods of
communication other than visual, such as tactile and sensory.
The formal elements of art, craft and design are generally listed as aspects of colour, line,
tone, texture and shape or form. However, this is far from being an exclusive list. Other
formal qualities can offer inspiration and valuable approaches to the development of ideas.
Examples include transparency, opacity, key, space, plasticity, energy, tension, time, scale,
movement, contrast, rhythm, and pattern.
Skills
This specification requires students to demonstrate the ability to:
• develop their ideas through investigations informed by selecting and critically analysing
sources
• apply an understanding of relevant practices in the creative and cultural industries to
their work
• refine their ideas as work progresses through experimenting with media, materials,
techniques and processes
• record their ideas, observations, insights and independent judgements, visually and
through written annotation, using appropriate specialist vocabulary, as work progresses
• use visual language critically as appropriate to their own creative intentions and chosen
area(s) of study through effective and safe use of: media, materials, techniques,
processes and technologies

GCSE ART and DESIGN 8
• use drawing skills for different needs and purposes, appropriate to the context, for
example, using drawing as part of the development process within each chosen area of
study
• realise personal intentions through the sustained application of the creative process.
Students following GCSE Art and Design specifications must use drawing to support the
development process within each chosen area of study. Students are not required to
demonstrate technical mastery of drawing skills unless this is relevant to their area of
study. (See Appendix A, Drawing, for a full explanation of this requirement.)
Written work
It should be noted that there is a requirement for students to record their ideas,
observations, insights and independent judgements, not only in visual terms but also
through written annotation. Students may also wish to provide more substantial statements
in support of their working processes. The context and form of such writing will be
determined by what the student wishes to communicate or express. For example, more
extended forms of writing may be employed when students write about their encounters
with the work of others or explain and reflect upon the development of their ideas in their
Creative Statements. Whether students are using annotation and/or more extended
formats they should use a style of writing which is suitable for purpose, is legible, clear and
coherent, and utilises appropriate specialist vocabulary. Written work may be presented in
either hand written and/or digital form.
Students may use annotation or more extended forms of writing to show how they have
met any one, or any combination, of the assessment objectives. In AO1, it is expected that
written work will demonstrate critical and contextual understanding. In AO2, for example,
written commentary may be used to consider the relationships between practical working
methods and outcomes, as well as demonstrating ongoing critical review. In AO3, students
may use written notes, in conjunction with drawing, as a means of recording observations
and demonstrating critical reflection and insight into their investigations. In AO4, for
example, students may use annotation to add meaning to their work and to evaluate their
working processes.
Throughout the course students should be encouraged to appreciate the value of
annotation and understand how, when allied to practical investigation, it can form an
integral feature of the creative process. Both written and practical responses should be
purposefully integrated, should complement each other, and will be assessed holistically.

2.1 Qualification Titles
This specification requires students to develop and apply the knowledge, understanding
and skills (set out in the introduction to Section 2) in ways relevant to the recognised
progression routes for the subject. To ensure transparency for end users, separate GCSE
Art and Design qualification titles must be used which correspond to these routes.
This GCSE specification in Art and Design offers a choice of seven titles. Each title offers
a further choice of areas of study but work need not be limited to a single one of these. The
Portfolio and Externally Set Assignment may include aspects of any of the areas of study
separately or in combination.
Each of the following titles is recognised as a distinct GCSE qualification:
Art and Design (Art, Craft and Design)
Art and Design (Fine Art)
Art and Design (Graphic Communication)
Art and Design (Textile Design)
Art and Design (Three-Dimensional Design)
Art and Design (Photography)
Art and Design (Critical and Contextual Studies).
Each title is summarised in Section 2.2 and clarified further in Section 2.5.
The indicative content in Appendix C provides guidance to teachers and students on the
kinds of evidence required to fulfil each assessment objective in the context of each title.

2.3 Component 1
Portfolio
This component consists of a major practical project/theme-based portfolio and outcome/s
with integrated critical and contextual analysis. Assignments, briefs or themes undertaken
are to be determined by the student and teacher.
This component is designed to enable students to effectively develop an introductory
foundation of core skills and encourage engagement with exciting creative experiences
which build fundamental learning, knowledge, contextualisation skills and critical thinking.
The time available for this component also provides opportunities to focus on the
acquisition of valuable skills (which include experimentation, risk-taking, drawing, the
application of the formal elements and the ability to analyse and synthesise information and
ideas) as well as to develop and refine techniques.
The introductory aspects of the course will culminate in a practical project/portfolio, in
which students should develop, in consultation with their teacher, a body of work based on
a theme, concept or specific design brief which is of personal significance and links to the
contexts of contemporary and/or past artists, designers or craftspeople.
The Portfolio is internally assessed and externally moderated (centres must ensure that
marks are submitted to WJEC by the May deadline). Work produced for this component will
be assessed in relation to all four assessment objectives.

GCSE ART and DESIGN 14
2.4 Component 2
Externally Set Assignment
This component represents the culmination of students' GCSE study and provides both
focus and challenge. Students are required to develop a personal response to one of a
varied range of stimuli within specified time constraints. Students must therefore bring
together the best of their understanding, knowledge and skills built up over their course of
study and demonstrate their highest achievement through this externally set assignment.
The Externally Set Assignment materials consist of a series of assignments based on
themes, visual stimuli and written briefs set by WJEC. Students are required to select one
of the set assignments and develop it in the form of:
• a personal response
• a specific design brief
• or another suitable approach.
Students will develop their response over a preparatory period (the duration of which is to
be determined by the centre). Responses must take the form of critical, practical and
contextual preparatory work and/or supporting studies, which will inform the resolution of
these ideas in a sustained focus study.
Following the preparatory study period, students will be allocated a period of 10 hours
sustained focus study to realise their response unaided and under supervised conditions.
Once the 10 hour sustained focus period has commenced, students must not have access
outside the sustained focus period session either to their preparatory study and research
work or to work produced during the sustained focus period. At the end of each sustained
focus session all candidates’ Component 2 work must be stored securely by the centre to
ensure that no additional work is brought in or taken out of the designated workplace.
At the conclusion of their preparatory study and sustained focus periods of work, students
will be required to select, evaluate and present their submissions for assessment. Work
completed during the sustained focus period must be clearly identified. In addition,
students must ensure that all secondary source material is appropriately acknowledged. If
work is included in the submission which is not entirely that of the student, such as quotes
and images produced by others, it is essential that each of these is specifically identified
and acknowledged.
Students are assessed on their ability to work independently, within specific time
constraints and in relation to all four assessment objectives. Both the preparatory study
and sustained focus work are assessed together. (See Section 3.2 for conditions relating
to the Externally Set Assignment.)

GCSE ART AND DESIGN 15
The supervised sustained focus period
• The Externally Set Assignment materials set by WJEC are to be released to students
on or after 2 January in the calendar year in which the assessment is to be taken.
• The start of the preparatory study period is defined as the date upon which the
Externally Set Assignment materials are presented to the student. The preparatory
study period may commence on or after 2 January. The preparatory study period
finishes upon commencement of the sustained focus work.
• The start and finish dates of the preparatory study period and the 10 hour sustained
focus study are determined by the centre but will need to take into account the May
deadline for the submission of marks to WJEC.
• Work is internally assessed and externally moderated.

2.5 Titles in Detail
Introduction
The following subject content for titles within the specification is indicative and is designed
to offer teachers and students choice and provide helpful details showing the possible
breadth and diversity within art and design disciplines. Further discussion of titles and
related areas of study will be provided within the WJEC GCSE Teachers’ Guide. Centres
should ensure that students have access to an appropriate range of specialist resources
relating to the titles they have selected before embarking on such courses. All titles allow
students to work solely with digital media within any title provided the aims and assessment
objectives are met. Within each title, students’ work should integrate practical and
critical/contextual work.
Knowledge, skills and understanding
All the following titles require students to demonstrate the knowledge, skills and
understanding set out in the introduction to Section 2, through the areas of study relevant
to their chosen title.
Art and Design (Art, Craft and Design)
This title offers a broad-based course designed to promote learning across a variety of
experiences. Art, Craft and Design can involve use of an almost limitless range of techniques,
processes and materials, including those that are recyclable. A wide range of processes, tools,
techniques, materials and resources may be employed to create artefacts and to generate
diverse evidence of working methods and outcomes.
The emphasis is on an increased breadth of approach commensurate in demand with the
depth of learning required in the more specialised titles. Art, Craft and Design can be
distinguished from other titles in as much as students are able to explore personal interests
and demonstrate their abilities across a particularly broad course of study.
Students must also explore practical and relevant critical and contextual sources such as the
work of historical and contemporary artists, craftspeople and designers as well as the different
purposes, intentions and functions of art, craft and design as appropriate to their own work.
Art, Craft and Design offers flexibility in content and approach and students undertaking this
option must explore and create work associated with at least two of the titles listed below:
• Fine Art
• Graphic Communication
• Textile Design
• Three-dimensional Design
• Photography
• Critical and Contextual Studies.

GCSE ART AND DESIGN 17
Art, Craft and Design: terms and definitions
The following broad, working definitions of ‘art’, ‘craft’ and ‘design’ are provided in the interests of
clarity although it should be understood that precise demarcations between these activities are
impossible; these fields are often interdependent and interrelated.
Art
Art combines practical and intellectual activity and tends to focus on creative expression.
Processes and outcomes are influenced by certain constraints or intentions, many of which are
personally determined by the artist. Processes can be structured or open-ended and might involve
exploration of experiences, feelings, perceptions and observations that may include direct, critical
and analytical study of artefacts, objects, places and people. They may be initiated by the
individual or in response to given stimuli, such as a theme, issue, or problem. Outcomes can
reflect the individual’s imagination, influences and intentions in following an idea, conveying an
experience or expressing feelings, often with the purpose of engaging those who will see the work.
Craft
Craft combines practical and intellectual skills and focuses on creatively using them to sensitively
and intelligently manipulate materials, tools and processes. It involves applying knowledge and
understanding of materials and their working characteristics, together with specific craft skills and
creative intentions that take account of the needs of both the maker and the user of the final
outcome. Although students need to have a working knowledge and appreciation of traditional
materials, tools and processes, they should also be familiar with the use of new and emerging
materials and technologies in contemporary craftwork. It is essential for appropriate emphasis to
be placed not just on manual skills but also on creative ideas and imaginative approaches to the
use of materials and processes.
Design
Design places emphasis on the way practical and intellectual activity combine in order to respond
to the wants and needs of people. The designer may generate design briefs alone or at the behest
of a client. This tends to distinguish design from art and craft procedures that have largely been
initiated by the individual artist or craftsperson. The designer tends to work within externally set
parameters and takes account of such matters as the use that is to be made of the outcome in
terms of durability, ergonomics, aesthetic appearance, costs, and the availability of materials,
ethical considerations and methods of production. Processes and outcomes can range from the
quirky, imaginative and risky to the thoughtful adaptation of existing designs – design is often an
incremental process of continuing small improvements. An understanding of the importance of the
relationship between form and function is essential.
In Component 1, the Portfolio, students opting for Art, Craft and Design should explore both
practical and critical and contextual work. The work selected for portfolios must include examples
of two-dimensional and/or three-dimensional processes and media associated with areas of study
from more than one specialist title. It is recommended that the detailed descriptions of the
specialist titles that follow should be reviewed to inform the range of possible areas of study.
In Component 2, the Externally Set Assignment, students can choose to produce preparatory
studies and work in the sustained period of focused study that reflects one or more of the
specialist titles.

GCSE ART and DESIGN 18
All work submitted for both Components 1 and 2 will be assessed holistically in relation to the four
assessment objectives, taking account of the breadth and depth of the evidence presented.
Students undertaking this title must explore selected practical and contextual areas of art, craft
and design through a range of two and/or three dimensional media and processes. Art, craft and
design can involve the use of an almost limitless range of techniques, processes and materials,
including those that are recyclable, but due regard should be given to achieving reasonable depth
as well as breadth of learning experiences.
In order to provide sufficient opportunities for research into art, craft and design practice, students
can explore practitioners working in occupations associated with the specialist titles, Fine Art,
Graphic Communication, Textile Design, Three-dimensional Design or Photography and areas of
study related to these.
As part of their studies for Art, craft and design students should aim to present clear
evidence of addressing the assessment objectives, as in the following examples.
AO1
• Develop ideas that are informed by investigative, contextual and cultural studies of
historical and contemporary art, craft and design and other sources relevant to their
selected areas of study in their own and other societies.
• Explore a wide variety of work produced by artists, craftspeople and designers and the
differences in their methods, approaches, purposes and intentions.
• Provide evidence of analytical skills and critical and contextual understanding by
appraising, comparing and contrasting the work of relevant artists, craftspeople and
designers and other historical and contextual sources, using this evidence to inform their
own work.
• Increase awareness of the wide variety of art, craft and design processes and outcomes
and the differences between them, including the more utilitarian applications of art, craft
and design forms.
AO2
• Refine and reflect upon work as it progresses by exploring ideas, selecting and
experimenting with appropriate media, materials, techniques and processes. Exercise
skilful and safe application of these to maximise creative potential and produce quality
outcomes.
• Explore a stimulating and rich variety of resources to initiate and develop innovative ideas.
Pay due regard to line, tone, colour, shape, texture and other visual elements and, where
appropriate, use drawing to explore and communicate ideas.
• Provide evidence of appropriate depth and breadth of study and employ sensitive control,
for example, in refining detail in the design and production of ceramic pieces, or in using
tone or colour accurately, or establishing relationships between typography and images.
• Show discrimination in reviewing ideas as work develops. Establish a clear working
relationship between working methods and outcomes by documenting significant steps so
that final outcomes do not emerge without evidence of the creative process.

GCSE ART AND DESIGN 19
AO3
• Gather, select, organise and communicate information that is relevant to their personal
interests as a consequence of careful research and analysis of a rich variety of resources.
• Record ideas, first-hand observations, insights and judgments by any suitable means,
especially drawing, including for example, line, colour, tonal and textural studies,
photographs and annotation in sketchbooks, study sheets and/or on tablets or other
means, to support personal intentions.
• Critically reflect on work as it progresses in order to review what has been learned, acquire
deeper understanding and clarify purposes and meanings.
• Consider opportunities, where appropriate, to transfer knowledge, skills and understanding
to new contexts. For example, by adapting a small-scale ceramic form to a design for land
art.
AO4
• Present personal, imaginative final outcomes that, together with selective evidence of
thinking and production processes, effectively realise the student’s stated intentions and
demonstrate critical understanding of visual, tactile and, where appropriate, other forms of
communication.
• Make explicit connections, where appropriate, between the different elements of the
submission, including contextual, practical and written responses, presenting work that is
meaningful, well-informed and in a sequence that can be easily followed.
• Consider different presentational formats and select the most appropriate for the
submission. Due regard should be given to the purpose of the work and how it might
engage the interest of an audience. For example, visuals and text can be used to show
how an initial idea for a fine art piece could be developed into a poster for a music festival.

GCSE ART and DESIGN 20
Art and Design (Fine Art)
Possible areas of study include:
• Drawing
• Installation
• Lens and light-based media
• Mixed media
• Land art
• Printing
• Painting
• Sculpture.
Work is not limited to one area of study.
Fine art is defined here as that aspect of art, craft and design where work is developed primarily
for aesthetic, intellectual or conceptual purposes rather than considerations that are principally
functional and utilitarian.
Students undertaking this title must explore practical and relevant critical and contextual sources
such as the work of historical and contemporary fine artists and the different purposes, intentions
and functions of fine art as appropriate to their own work. They should demonstrate the ability to
work creatively with processes and techniques appropriate to their chosen area study such as:
painting (various media); drawing (various media); printing (e.g. screen printing; etching; aquatint;
lithography; block printing; stencils; carving; modelling; constructing; mosaic; mobiles;
environmental art; graffito; kinetic media; light-based media; digital media; mixed media. This is a
broad and developing area of study that also includes performance and conceptual art, as well as
aspects of printmaking, photography and film.
Fine art offers a choice of traditional, digital media and processes and involves expressive use of
a particularly wide range of materials, techniques and skills, including those that are recyclable.
In order to provide sufficient opportunities for research into contemporary fine art practice,
students can explore practitioners working in such areas as film, publishing, arts administration,
museums and galleries, community arts and teaching and all occupations associated with this
title.
As part of their studies for Fine art students should aim to present clear evidence of
addressing the assessment objectives, as in the following examples.
AO1
• Develop ideas that are informed by investigative, contextual and cultural studies of
historical and contemporary fine art and other sources such as architecture, music,
dance, drama, production design and published media and the place of fine art within
these in their own and other societies.
• Explore a wide variety of work produced by fine artists and understand the differences
in their methods, approaches, purposes and intentions.
• Provide evidence of analytical skills and critical and contextual understanding by
appraising, comparing and contrasting the work of relevant fine artists and other
historical and contextual sources and use this to inform their own work.
• Increase awareness of the wide variety of fine art processes and outcomes and the
differences between fine art sculpture, ceramics, printmaking and photography and the
more utilitarian application of these art, craft and design forms.

GCSE ART AND DESIGN 21
AO2
• Refine and reflect upon work as it progresses by exploring ideas, selecting and
experimenting with appropriate breadth of fine art media, techniques and processes,
singly and in combination. Exercise skilful and safe application of these to maximise
creative potential and produce quality outcomes.
• Explore a stimulating and rich variety of resources to initiate and develop innovative ideas
Pay due regard to line, tone, colour, shape, texture and other visual elements to explore
and communicate ideas.
• Provide evidence of appropriate depth and breadth of study of fine art practices, including
drawing as an end in itself. Employ sensitive control, for example, in refining detail or in
using accurate or exaggerated colour and tone.
• Show discrimination in reviewing ideas as work develops. Establish a clear working
relationship between working methods and outcomes by documenting significant steps so
that final outcomes do not emerge without evidence of the creative process.
AO3
• Gather, select, organise and communicate information that is relevant to their personal
interests as a consequence of careful research and analysis of a rich variety of resources.
• Record ideas, first-hand observations, insights and judgments by any suitable means,
especially drawing, and including, for example, line, colour, tonal and textural studies,
photographs and annotation in sketchbooks, study sheets and/or on tablets or other
means, to support personal intentions.
• Critically reflect on work as it progresses in order to review what has been learned,
acquire deeper understanding and clarify purposes and meanings.
AO4
• Present personal, imaginative final outcomes that, together with selective evidence of
thinking and production processes, effectively realise the student’s stated intentions and
demonstrate critical understanding of visual, tactile and, where appropriate, other forms of
communication.
• Make explicit connections, where appropriate, between the different elements of the
submission, including contextual, practical and written responses, presenting work that is
meaningful, well-informed and in a sequence that can be easily followed and results in
quality outcomes.
• Consider different presentational formats and select the most appropriate for the
submission. Due regard should be given to the purpose of the work and how it might
engage the interest of an audience. For example, preliminary drawings, photographs and
notes can be used to show how a sequence of images of a flower from bud stage to final
decay might be developed into a painted triptych.

GCSE ART and DESIGN 22
Art and Design (Graphic Communication)
Possible areas of study include:
• Advertising
• Communication graphics
• Design for print
• Illustration
• Interactive design (including web, app and game)
• Multi-media
• Package design
• Signage
• Typography.
Work is not limited to one area of study.
Graphic Communication is defined here as the process of creating primarily visual material to
convey information, ideas and emotions through the use of graphic elements such as symbols,
diagrams, drawings, photographs, maps and typography. This option encompasses a wide and
developing area of study, incorporating a variety of related disciplines and utilising traditional
skills, such as calligraphy and hand-formed lettering, alongside cutting-edge digital technologies.
Boundaries between related graphic processes are becoming increasingly blurred. The following
indicate what might be covered within this title: computer aided design; web design, apps and
games; letterforms; typography; drawing; technical and book illustration; design for print; TV
idents, film title sequences, photography and package design.
Students undertaking this title must explore practical and relevant critical and contextual sources,
such as the work of historical and contemporary graphic designers and the different purposes,
intentions and functions of graphic communication as appropriate to their own work. They should
demonstrate the ability to work creatively with processes and techniques appropriate to their
chosen area. Outcomes may be two- or three-dimensional or time-based, taking the form of
posters, brochures, flyers, T-shirts, CD/DVD sleeves, book covers, magazine spreads, calendars,
stamps, packaging, publicity materials, vehicle livery, billboards, advertising, logos, branding,
corporate identity, audio-visual (e.g. time-based and animated graphics), three-dimensional point-
of-sale and exhibition design.
Designers often combine images and letterform/type to communicate a client’s message to an
audience and explore the creative possibilities presented by combining words and images. It is
the task of the designer not only to find or create appropriate letterforms and images but also to
establish the best balance between them.
In order to provide sufficient opportunities for research into contemporary practice, students can
explore practitioners working in such areas as general illustration, typography, corporate identity
and branding consultancy, information graphics, computer-generated imagery, 2D animation, 3D
modelling, design for learning, print technology, web design, television, video and computer
games.

GCSE ART AND DESIGN 23
As part of their studies for Graphic communication students should aim to present clear
evidence of addressing the assessment objectives, as in the following examples.
AO1
• Develop ideas that are informed by investigative, contextual and cultural studies of historical
and contemporary graphic design and other sources relevant to their selected area of study
in their own and other societies.
• Explore a wide variety of work produced by graphic communicators and understand the
differences in their methods, approaches, purposes and intentions such as ethical
considerations, marketing strategies, promotional campaigning, and design for print and the
web.
• Provide evidence of analytical skills and critical and contextual understanding by appraising,
comparing and contrasting the work of relevant graphic communicators and other historical
and contextual sources, using this to inform their own work.
• Increase awareness of the wide variety of graphic communication processes and outcomes
and the differences between these.
AO2
• Refine and reflect upon work as it progresses by exploring ideas, selecting and
experimenting with appropriate breadth of graphic communication approaches and
processes, including the purposeful manipulation of digital software. Exercise skilful and safe
application of these to maximise creative potential and produce quality outcomes.
• Explore a stimulating and rich variety of resources to initiate and develop innovative ideas.
Pay due regard to line, tone, colour, shape, texture and other visual elements to explore and
communicate ideas.
• Provide evidence of appropriate depth and breadth of study of graphic communication
practices, including drawing as a means to explore and communicate ideas. Employ sensitive
control, for example in refining detail, such as selection of fonts, relationship of typography to
images and recognising suitable reprographic processes.
• Show discrimination in reviewing ideas as work develops. Establish a clear working
relationship between working methods and outcomes by documenting significant steps so
that final outcomes do not emerge without evidence of the creative process.
AO3
• Gather, select, organise and communicate information that is relevant to their personal
interests as a consequence of careful research and analysis of a stimulating and rich
variety of resources.
• Record ideas, first-hand observations, insights and judgments by any suitable means, such
as layout drawings, thumbnail sketches, storyboards and written notes that are relevant to
and support personal intentions.
• Critically reflect on work as it progresses in order to review what has been learned, acquire
deeper understanding and clarify purposes and meanings.
AO4
• Present personal, imaginative final outcomes, together with selective evidence of thinking
and production processes, that effectively realise the student’s stated intentions, fulfil any
design brief and demonstrate critical understanding of visual and, where appropriate, other
forms of communication.
• Make explicit connections, where appropriate, between the different elements of the
submission, including contextual, practical and written responses, presenting work that is
meaningful, well-informed and in a sequence that can be easily followed and results in
quality outcomes.
• Consider different presentational formats and select the most appropriate for the
submission. Due regard should be given to the purpose of the work and how it might
engage the interest of an audience or potential clients. For example, alternative ideas might
be presented using PowerPoint to show possible layouts, colourways and typefaces as well
as how large-scale work such as billboards might look in location.

Art and Design (Textile Design)
Possible areas of study include:
• Constructed textiles
• Digital textiles
• Dyed fabrics
• Printed fabrics
• Fashion design
• Installed textiles
• Soft furnishings
• Stitched and/or embellished textiles.
Work is not limited to one area of study.
Textile Design is defined here as the creation of designs and products for woven, knitted, stitched
or printed fabrics and involves an understanding of fibres, yarns and fabrics.
Students undertaking this title must explore practical and relevant critical and contextual sources
such as the work of historical and contemporary textile designers and makers, as well as the
different purposes, intentions and functions of textile design as appropriate to their own work. There
are close links between constructed, embellished, printed, sewn and dyed methods of textile design
and with fashion design and installed textiles. Interdisciplinary opportunities might be explored as
well as developing a specialisation in one area. Students should demonstrate the ability to work
creatively with processes and techniques appropriate to the chosen areas of study such as:
weaving, surface printing (block, screen or digital), pattern making, pattern cutting, embroidery
(machine or hand), knitting, batik, soft sculpture, appliqué and collage.
Textile Design encompasses a very broad range of materials, techniques and processes, including
recyclable materials and a growing number of interdisciplinary approaches. The range is increasing
as new materials and technologies emerge, for example, in the field of ‘intelligent textiles’.
In order to provide sufficient opportunities for research into contemporary practice, students can
explore practitioners working in occupations such as a textile designer, textile buyer, fashion
designer, fashion forecaster, knitwear designer, milliner, fashion journalist, colour consultant,
theatrical costume designer, fashion illustrator, pattern-cutter and designer-maker.
As part of their studies for Textile design students should aim to present clear evidence of
addressing the assessment objectives, as in the following examples.
AO1
• Develop ideas that are informed by investigative, contextual and cultural studies of historical
and contemporary textile design in their own and other societies and other sources, for
example fine art and crafts such as jewellery.
• Explore a wide variety of work produced by textile designers and understand the differences in
their methods, approaches, purposes and intentions, such as ethical, cultural, aesthetic and
utilitarian considerations.
• Provide evidence of analytical skills and critical and contextual understanding by appraising,
comparing and contrasting the work of relevant textile designers and other historical and
contextual sources, using this to inform their own work.
• Increase awareness of the wide variety of textile design processes and outcomes and the
differences between these, including relationships between functional, aesthetic, stylistic and
technological considerations and how these are applied and adapted to meet particular needs.
