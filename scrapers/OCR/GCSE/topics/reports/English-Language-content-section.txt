subject content which is typically taught at key stage 3
and provides a suitable foundation for the study of English Language at either AS or
A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile
course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

GCSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 5
This specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to achieve
because they have a particular protected characteristic.
The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.
The specification has been discussed with groups who represent the interests of a
diverse range of learners, and the specification will be kept under review.
Reasonable adjustments are made for certain learners in order to enable them to
access the assessments (e.g. application for extra time in a GCSE subject where
extended writing is required). Information on reasonable adjustments is found in the
following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access
Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments and Special Consideration: General and
Vocational Qualifications.
This document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk). As a consequence
of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will have a complete
barrier to any part of the assessment.
GCSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 6
The qualification is made up of two externally-assessed examination components
and one internally assessed non-examination component. The internally-assessed
non-examination component tests spoken language skills. Achievement in Spoken
Language will be reported as part of the qualification, but it will not form part of the
final mark and grade.
There is a slightly heavier weighting on the non-fiction Reading and Writing in
Component 2 than on the literature and creative writing in Component 1, in order to
ensure that skills for work, life and further education are prioritised. It is assumed
that the majority of learners will also be following a GCSE in English literature and will
therefore study a broad range of literature via that qualification.
This specification sets out the full range of content for GCSE English language.
Centres may, however, increase depth, breadth or context within the specified topics
to consolidate teaching of the subject content.
All texts in the examination will be ‘unseen’, that is, learners will not have studied
them before. These texts will be drawn from each of the 19th to 21st centuries, as
specified below.
GCSE English language is designed on the basis that learners should read and be
assessed on high-quality, challenging texts from the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.
Each text studied in the classroom must represent a substantial piece of writing,
making significant demands on learners in terms of content, structure and the quality
of language. The texts, across a range of genres and types, should support learners
in developing their own writing by providing effective models. The texts must include
literature and extended literary non-fiction, and other writing such as essays, reviews
and journalism (both printed and online). Texts that are essentially transient, such as
instant news feeds, will not be used for examination purposes.
The WJEC Eduqas GCSE specification in English language requires learners to
study:
 Critical reading and comprehension: identifying and interpreting themes,
ideas and information in a range of literature and other high-quality writing;
reading in different ways for different purposes, and comparing and
evaluating the usefulness, relevance and presentation of content for these
purposes; drawing inferences and justifying these with evidence; supporting
a point of view by referring to evidence within the text; identifying bias and
misuse of evidence, including distinguishing between statements that are
supported by evidence and those that are not; reflecting critically and
evaluatively on text, using the context of the text and drawing on knowledge
and skills gained from wider reading; recognising the possibility of different
responses to a text
© WJEC CBAC Ltd.
GCSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 7
 Summary and synthesis: identifying the main theme or themes; summarising
ideas and information from a single text; synthesising from more than one
text
 Evaluation of a writer’s choice of vocabulary, form, grammatical and
structural features: explaining and illustrating how vocabulary and grammar
contribute to effectiveness and impact, using linguistic and literary
terminology accurately to do so and paying attention to detail; analysing and
evaluating how form and structure contribute to the effectiveness and impact
of a text
 Comparing texts: comparing two or more texts critically with respect to the
above.
 Producing clear and coherent text: writing effectively for different purposes
and audiences: to describe, narrate, explain, instruct, give and respond to
information, and argue; selecting vocabulary, grammar, form, and structural
and organisational features judiciously to reflect audience, purpose and
context; using language imaginatively and creatively; using information
provided by others to write (in different forms); maintaining a consistent point
of view; maintaining coherence and consistency across a text
 Writing for impact: selecting, organising and emphasising facts, ideas and
key points; citing evidence and quotation effectively and pertinently to
support views; creating emotional impact; using language creatively,
imaginatively and persuasively, including rhetorical devices (such as
rhetorical questions, antithesis, parenthesis).
 Present information and ideas: selecting and organising information and
ideas effectively and persuasively for prepared spoken presentations;
planning effectively for different purposes and audiences; making
presentations and speeches
 Respond to spoken language: listening to and responding appropriately to
any questions and feedback
 Spoken Standard English: expressing ideas using Standard English
whenever and wherever appropriate.
GCSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 8
Section A (20%) – Reading (40 marks)
This section will test through structured questions the reading of an unseen extract from one
20th century literary prose text (about 60-100 lines). This section assesses AO1, AO2 and
AO4.
Section B (20%) – Prose Writing (40 marks)
This section will test creative prose writing through one 40-mark task. Candidates will be
offered a choice of four titles giving opportunities for writing to describe and narrate, and
imaginative and creative use of language. This response should be a narrative / recount.
Candidates who write purely descriptively, or use a form other than that specified, such as
poetry or drama, will not be able to access the full mark range as shown in the assessment
criteria. This section assesses AO5 and AO6.
Section A (30%) – Reading (40 marks)
This section will test through structured questions the reading of two high-quality unseen
non-fiction texts (about 900-1200 words in total), one from the 19th century, the other from
the 21st century. Non-fiction texts may include, but will not be limited to: letters, extracts
from autobiographies or biographies, diaries, reports, articles and digital and multi-modal
texts of various kinds from newspapers and magazines, and the internet. This section
assesses AO1 (and 2), AO2, AO3 and AO4.
Section B (30%) – Writing (40 marks)
This section will test transactional, persuasive and/or discursive writing through two equally
weighted compulsory tasks (20 marks each). Across the two tasks candidates will be
offered opportunities to write for a range of audiences and purposes, adapting style to form
and to real-life contexts in, for example, letters, articles, reviews, speeches, etc. This section
assesses AO5 and AO6.

SPOKEN LANGUAGE ENDORSEMENT FOR GCSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
This endorsement will be reported as a separate grade (Pass, Merit, Distinction or
Not Classified) and will not contribute to the result of the GCSE English Language
qualification.
This outline of the requirements has been produced in collaboration with all the
relevant awarding bodies. Further clarification will be available in the JCQ
Instructions for conducting non-examination assessments.
Tasks
Candidates must undertake a prepared spoken presentation on a specific topic. As a
guide, the duration of the whole assessment should be no more than ten minutes.
The key requirements are:
 Presentations must be formal but may take a wide variety of forms, including
talks, debates, speeches and dialogues.
 Candidates must identify the subject for their presentations in advance and agree
with their teacher.
 Presentations must be planned and organised. Candidates should be advised
that lack of preparation is likely to prevent access to the criteria for the higher
grades.
 Candidates may use pre-prepared notes, PowerPoint etc to assist them during
their presentations but this is not a requirement.
 As part of, or following, the presentation, candidates must listen to and respond
appropriately to questions and feedback.
 Where the audience is the teacher only, the presentation and dialogue must be
designed in such a way that it could have a potentially wider audience than just
one person (e.g. it replicates a television interview).
GCSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 12
Assessment
No marks will be assigned to a candidate's performance - it will be assessed
holistically as a grade, using a 'competency' basis on criteria which are provided on
page 14. Competency means that a student must meet all the criteria in one grade
before moving on to the next. Candidates who do not reach the Pass standard must
be recorded as Not Classified.
Centres must make arrangements for internal standardisation of assessments. This
should take place as far as possible before assessment begins in earnest. Internal
standardisation should include a preliminary trial assessment session (including all
teachers involved in assessment) using exemplar material provided by the awarding
bodies, in order to ensure that there is a common understanding of the assessment
criteria.
Monitoring
The endorsement will be assessed by centres. Each centre is required to provide
audio-visual recordings of the presentations of a sample of candidates (see below).
These will allow us to check that centres have used appropriate tasks, and have
applied the assessment criteria correctly and consistently.
The centre must provide recordings of the presentations of a sample of candidates.
The recording of each candidate's presentation, including questions and feedback
from the audience, must be complete and unedited.
Using their knowledge of candidates' likely performance, centres should select the
sample following the guidance shown in the table below. Centres are recommended
to record slightly more than the minimum number at each grade to allow for
candidates whose performance is awarded a higher or lower grade than the centre
had anticipated. WJEC will provide details regarding the storage and submission of
recordings.

GCSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 13
This is a broad overview of what is required. Further information on arrangements for
learners with communication issues and / or hearing needs may be found in the
appendices.
If the awarding body has concerns as a result of monitoring, the centre will be
provided with additional support (which may include a visit by a monitor) in the
following academic year. In exceptional circumstances there will be enhanced
monitoring arrangements which may include an earlier deadline for submission of
assessments or a requirement to record the presentations of all candidates.
Candidate absence
Where a candidate misses the scheduled date/time for his/her presentation, the
centre must organise an alternative session.
A candidate who is unable to undertake his/her presentation because of persistent
absence (whether through ill health or any other reason) will not qualify for special
consideration and will receive a 'Not Classified' result for the Spoken Language
endorsement. However, standard procedures for sitting at an alternative venue do
apply, if appropriate.
Entries and centre declaration
Entries for GCSE English Language automatically include the Spoken Language
endorsement.
The head of centre is required to provide a written declaration to us by a published
deadline to confirm that reasonable steps have been taken to ensure that all
candidates whom the centre has entered for GCSE English Language have
undertaken the Spoken Language endorsement.

GCSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 15
This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the
course. Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer and November
series each year, until the end of the life of this specification. Summer 2017 will be
the first assessment opportunity.
A qualification may be taken more than once. Candidates must resit all examination
components in the same series.
The endorsement grade for NEA may be carried forward for the life of the
specification, even if it was awarded by a different awarding body. If a candidate
resits an NEA component (rather than carrying forward the previous NEA
endorsement grade), it is the new grade that will be used, even if this is 'Not
Classified'.
Where a candidate has certificated on two or more previous occasions, the most
recent NEA endorsement grade is carried forward, even if this is 'Not Classified'.
Candidates who take an assessment in the November series must have reached at
least the age of 16 on or before 31 August in the same calendar year as the
assessment.
The entry code appears below.
WJEC Eduqas GCSE English Language: C700QS
The current edition of our Entry Procedures and Coding Information gives up-to-date
entry procedures.
GCSE qualifications are reported on a nine point scale from 1 to 9, where 9 is the
highest grade. Results not attaining the minimum standard for the award will be
reported as U (unclassified).
GCSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 16
Introduction
This document has been produced by the awarding bodies for England to support
learners with communication and/or hearing needs in the Spoken Language
Endorsement for GCSE English Language. It has been developed jointly with
representatives from the British Association of Teachers of the Deaf, The
Communication Trust, National Deaf Children's Society and the Royal National
Institute of Blind People. It should be read in conjunction with the GCSE English
Language specification from your awarding body and common assessment criteria.
The aim of this document is to encourage access to the Endorsement for as many
learners as possible and provide practical guidance and support for their teachers.
This document focuses on the arrangements for the assessment element of the
Spoken Language Endorsement. However, it is important to ensure that, throughout
the GCSE course and particularly for learners with communication and/or hearing
needs, there is continuing language development work that is over and above any of
the requirements specifically related to the Endorsement.
Access to the Endorsement
For Heads of Centre the most important responsibility in relation to the Endorsement
is to ensure that as many learners as possible are offered full access to the
opportunities that the Endorsement will give. While exemption may be appropriate for
some learners with protected characteristics (as defined in the Equality Act 2010), for
most it will not be. In these latter cases it is the responsibility of the Head of Centre to
ensure that all such learners have the opportunity to take the Endorsement.
Heads' responsibilities in this area will be supported in two main ways:
 They will have to sign the annual Head of Centre declaration.
 There will be an annual monitoring exercise undertaken by the awarding bodies
to identify and understand patterns of centre behaviour where surprisingly large
numbers of Exemptions/Not Classified results occurred.
Flexibility of the Requirements
To support full access, Ofqual's requirements for the Endorsement contain
considerable flexibility around provision for individual learners. Of special interest to
teachers of learners with communication and/or hearing needs are the following:
© WJEC CBAC Ltd.
GCSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 17
 Format
Various formats of presentation are allowed, including talks, debates, speeches and
dialogues. The most common format in mainstream centres is likely to be the formal
individual 'talk', in front of an audience followed by questions, but there are other
ways in which learners can perform. Sample assessment materials, for example,
show learners in an individual dialogic format, where they are interviewed by a
teacher as part of a media type presentation.
It is suggested that discussions are held with the learner and any specialist
professional (e.g. speech and language therapist) and/or any specialist teachers (e.g.
Teachers of the Deaf) to consider the most appropriate format.
 The Requirement for Audibility and Intelligibility
The Assessment Criteria require as a starting point that the learner should be audible
and intelligible. The interpretation of 'audible' for the purposes of the endorsement
means the learner is audible to the person undertaking the assessment and any
audience present. Prompts can be given to encourage/remind the learner to speak
louder.
Some learners can only be clearly understood by peers and staff who have become
accustomed to their speech. Therefore, 'intelligibility' for the purposes of this
endorsement requires that the learner is intelligible to the person making the
assessment, who will have become attuned to the learner's speech over time.
 Presentation skills
The Assessment Criteria refer to learners' 'making an attempt to meet the needs of
the audience', which might be interpreted as including an assessment of their
presentation skills. Assessors should be mindful of the possible impact of a disability
such as vision impairment on a learner's body language and their ability to make eye
contact with the audience. Where this may be a factor, assessment should be carried
out by someone who is familiar with the learner and their individual needs.
 Recording
Not all learners have to be recorded. A sample of learners needs to be recorded,
once the centre entry goes beyond 30, but the centre chooses the sample.
Mainstream centres therefore do not need to record learners with communication
and/or hearing needs if they do not want to. Specialist centres, with 30 or fewer
learners, will still be able to apply to their awarding bodies for an exemption from
recording for those learners where recording would be a significant problem.
 Timings
There are no time limits to the presentation (at either end of the time scale).
Guidance will indicate that learners can do all that is necessary to access the highest
attainment levels within a presentation of 10 minutes but, where more time is
required, this is permissible. Guidance will also suggest that a very brief presentation
will offer learners limited opportunities to demonstrate their skills.
Pauses and rest periods are allowable - for instance between the presentation and
questions.
GCSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 18
 Notes, aids, amplification systems
Notes, PowerPoint, and visual aids are all permissible without restrictions on their
content, length etc. Amplification systems, such as FM systems for deaf learners are
permitted.
 Acoustic and room layout
It is important that all assessments for deaf learners (whether they have mild,
moderate, severe or profound loss) take place in locations with an acceptable
acoustic environment and with lighting good enough to facilitate speech/lip reading.
In fact, this will be to the benefit of all candidates.
Additionally, the seating arrangements/layout of the room are also very important for
speech/lip reading, e.g. if a member of the audience, assessor or questioner has
their back to a window, the deaf candidate will find it hard to speech/lip read. A
suitably experienced professional (e.g. Teacher of the Deaf) should advise on
appropriate layout and lighting.
 Composition of Audience
There is flexibility in the make-up and size of the presentation audience. An audience
can be a whole class, a small group, or an individual teacher. It could also comprise
older students, governors, teaching assistants, learning mentors etc. If the audience
comprises one person, they must ensure that their questions allow the learners the
opportunities to demonstrate their skills. Audience members are allowed to offer
encouragement, prompts and support to a learner. It is permissible to ask a learner to
speak up, repeat etc.
 A Prompter
A prompter could help a learner remember where they are up to their presentation, or
remind them what they have just said.
Arrangements which require Awarding Body approval
 Augmentative and alternative communication systems (AAC)
If the learners use alternative communication devices as their normal method of
communication, they can apply to the awarding body for permission to use this
method for their presentation.
 Sign Supported English or Cued Speech
Sign Supported English (SSE) or Cued Speech can be used, during the presentation,
or during the question stage to ensure that the learner is fully aware of the questions
being asked.
The use of Sign Supported English (SSE) or Cued Speech requires approval from
the awarding body
 British Sign Language
Please note that British Sign Language is NOT allowed, as this is a distinct language
in its own right and so is different from English.

GCSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 19
Conclusion
Awarding bodies hope that as many learners as possible will complete the Spoken
Language Endorsement alongside their GCSE in English Language. Where there are
issues which go beyond the scope of this document, please contact a specialist
practitioner (e.g. a Teacher of the Deaf or Speech and Language Therapist) and/or
your awarding body as appropriate for further advice.
