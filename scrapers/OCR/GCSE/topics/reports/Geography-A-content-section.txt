Component 3: Applied Fieldwork Enquiry
Learners should be given the opportunity to develop their skills of geographical
enquiry through fieldwork. They are expected to undertake two fieldwork enquiries,
each in a contrasting environment:
• a methodological approach should be taken in one environment *
• The second fieldwork experience should take place in a contrasting
environment. The focus of the fieldwork enquiry should be into one of
geography's conceptual frameworks*
* In each cycle the methodological approach and conceptual framework will be
selected by WJEC from those listed in Table A (page 24) and Table B (pages 25-26).
It is recommended that learners spend 18 guided learning hours on preparation for,
and consolidation of, fieldwork enquiry.
Learners should be given the opportunity to represent geographical data using a
range of cartographical and graphical techniques. They should also be given the
opportunity to analyse a variety of maps, graphs, photographs and data sets whilst
exploring the content of each component. The range and extent of mathematical and
statistical techniques required by WJEC Eduqas GCSE Geography A is outlined in
Appendix A on pages 30-31 of the specification. These techniques will be assessed
across all three components.

2.3 Component 3
Applied Fieldwork Enquiry
Written examination: 1 hour 30 minutes
30% of qualification
72 marks (plus 4 marks for spelling, punctuation, grammar and use of specialist
terms)
Component 3 is a written examination in three parts:
Part A will assess approaches to fieldwork methodology, representation and
analysis.
Part B will assess how fieldwork enquiry may be used to investigate geography's
broad conceptual frameworks.
Part C will assess the application of broad geographical concepts to a wider UK
context and assess the ability to make and justify a decision.
In order to prepare for this Component, learners are expected to undertake two fieldwork
enquiries outside the classroom and school grounds, each in a contrasting
environment:
• In one environment the fieldwork should include one methodological approach. The
approach will be selected by WJEC from those listed in Table A on page 24.
• The second fieldwork experience should take place in a contrasting environment.
This fieldwork enquiry must be underpinned by geography's conceptual framework.
The approach will be selected by WJEC from those listed in Table B on pages 25-26.
Teachers will be notified at least two years in advance which two approaches should be
taken by all centres in any given year. These approaches have been designed to allow
centres a wide range of choice of environment in which they can conduct fieldwork. They
should also allow centres to use familiar fieldwork locations that are known by them to be
safe. The sample assessment materials illustrate a cycle in which 'flows' is the
methodological approach selected from Table A and 'inequalities' is the conceptual
framework selected from Table B.
Learners should have the opportunity to carry out all six of the stages of the enquiry
process when conducting fieldwork. The stages of the enquiry process are described
fully on page 22. It is recommended that learners spend about 18 guided learning hours
preparing for and consolidating their understanding of their fieldwork experiences.
Learners might prepare for their fieldwork enquiry by being given opportunities to:
• pose geographical questions
• research fieldwork methodologies
• consider sampling strategies
• design data collection sheets.
Learners might consolidate their understanding of fieldwork enquiry by being given
opportunities to:
• process data
• present their findings
• analyse patterns and trends
• draw conclusions
• consider limitations of the evidence / evaluate their fieldwork.

Fieldwork enquiry skills that will be examined in Component 3
Examples (in italics) are to aid understanding and suggest range, and these are not compulsory.
The enquiry process Individuals should learn how to
1.1 What is the geographical 1.1 Pose questions about geographical processes/concepts
enquiry process? that include questioning about spatial patterns and
geographical processes/change. Test hypotheses.
1.2 How is evidence collected? 1.2 Design fieldwork data collection sheets. Select specific
locations at which data can be collected. Establish control
groups. Justify sample size and sampling technique,
coverage to include sampling using random, systematic,
opportunistic and/or stratified techniques. Use fieldwork
equipment to obtain accurate and reliable results (for
example the use of clinometer or quadrats).
Collect data using quantitative and qualitative techniques.
Quantitative techniques should include those that measure:
• flow (for example, discharge, infiltration, traffic)
• scale (for example, river width, pebble size, gradient)
• spatial pattern (for example, retail land use, sediment
sorting)
• temporal change (for example, temperature, rainfall,
pressure).
Qualitative techniques should include use of questionnaires,
bi-polar techniques and annotation of photos/sketches.
Use secondary sources of evidence to include satellite
images, aerial and oblique photographs, large databases (for
example, National Statistics) and GIS (for example,
Environment Agency).
1.3 How can evidence be 1.3 Process evidence to include calculation of percentages
processed and presented? and mean. Present evidence to include maps, graphs and
diagrams. Reference secondary data sources accurately. For

graphical and cartographic representation techniques, see
