2 SUBJECT CONTENT
This section outlines the knowledge, understanding and skills to be developed by
learners studying WJEC Eduqas GCSE in Electronics.
Learners should be prepared to apply the knowledge, understanding and skills
specified in a range of theoretical, practical, industrial and environmental contexts.
Learners' understanding of the connections between the different aspects of the
subject is a requirement of all GCSE specifications. In practice, this means that
synoptic questions will be set in each component. These questions will require
learners to draw upon knowledge from other parts of the specification.
Practical work is an intrinsic part of this specification. It is vitally important in
developing a conceptual understanding of many topics and it enhances the
experience and enjoyment of electronics. The practical skills developed are also
fundamentally important to learners going on to further study in electronics,
engineering and related subjects, and are transferable to many careers.
The specification content is organised in sections. Each section contains the
following:
Overview – summarises the content of each topic.
Electronic skills – summarises how skills may be developed in the topic.
Mathematical skills (where appropriate) – a summary of mathematical skills that
should be developed in each topic. The mathematical statements in each topic are
part of the assessed content. All of the mathematical skills in Appendix C are referred
to at least once in one of these topics.
Calculators may be used in both written examinations and in the NEA task.
Candidates are responsible for making sure that their calculators meet the relevant
regulations for use in written examinations: information is found in the JCQ
publication Instructions for conducting examinations.
Learners should be able to: – these statements clarify the breadth and depth of the
content for each topic.
Six appendices provide further details about:
Appendix A – Equations in electronics
Appendix B – SI units in electronics
Appendix C – Mathematical requirements and exemplification
Appendix D – Electronic symbols
Appendix E – Independence in non-exam assessment task
Appendix F – Assessment grid for non-exam assessment

2.3 Component 3
Extended system design and realisation task
Non-exam assessment (NEA)
20% of qualification
40 marks
The NEA is an integral part of the WJEC Eduqas GCSE in Electronics and
contributes 20% to the final assessment. This component requires each learner to
produce a single extended system design and realisation task independently. The
task builds on the systems developed throughout the specification and the
requirement to relate practical circuit design and construction to knowledge and
understanding within Components 1 and 2.
This component requires learners, in the context of the knowledge and
understanding in Components 1 and 2, to demonstrate their ability to:
(a) analyse a problem1 to enable solutions to be developed
(b) develop a design specification to solve a problem
(c) propose an electronic system, composed of sub-systems, to satisfy a design
specification
(d) make predictions about the way that electronic systems behave
(e) design and build an electronic system, model its performance against the
design specification and modify as appropriate
(f) plan tests to make measurements, to explore a problem and select
appropriate techniques and instruments
(g) evaluate practical risks in system development and application
(h) carry out tests having due regard to the correct manipulation of apparatus,
accuracy of measurement and Health and Safety considerations
(i) take and record measurements on electrical circuits
(j) report results using standard scientific conventions
(k) evaluate the performance of the electronic system against the design
specification
(l) suggest improvements to the electronic system following evaluation.
1 In the context of GCSE electronics skills, 'problem' is interpreted broadly, to embrace:
• problem – difficulties in a situation e.g. a person with partial hearing cannot hear the doorbell
• context – looking at situations for possible design openings e.g. a person crossing the road
• opportunity – possibilities arising e.g. from a new improved component
© WJEC CBAC Ltd.
GCSE ELECTRONICS 20
Task
The task enables learners to carry out a design and realisation task based on an
individually identified problem, context or opportunity. This will be researched and
analysed by the learner to develop their own specification to clearly guide their
system development. Learners will develop their system from a series of sub-
systems which will be tested individually before assembly and testing as a complete
system. Learners must evaluate the performance of their developed system against
their specification and suggest improvements that could be made.
Learners should be encouraged and supported to select tasks in which they are
interested and which are neither under nor over ambitious. Each learner's task is to
be signed off by the teacher. The teacher should discuss the proposed focus of the
task with the learner, considering the requirements of the assessment and the ability
and interests of the individual learner. The teacher must be satisfied that the
suggested focus has the potential for the individual learner to:
• analyse the problem and derive a design specification;
• develop and test a range of sub-systems;
• develop, realise and test a final physical system;
• evaluate the final system against the design specification and suggest
improvements.
This will help ensure the task is at a suitable level for the learner concerned and will
provide that individual with a level of challenge that is appropriate to their abilities, in
the context of the requirements of a GCSE Electronics qualification.
For projects that include microcontrollers programed using flowcharts, a sub-routine
can be considered a sub-system as long as a specification is provided for it and it
can be tested and evaluated in a similar fashion to a component based sub-system.
The learner should fully document the development of the task in a report. It is the
evidence contained within this report and the system produced upon which the NEA
should be marked and assessed. The report should provide evidence for the
following sections:
• System planning – including analysis of the problem and a design specification
• System development – including the development of the system in terms of sub-
systems, annotated circuit diagrams and description of testing each sub-system
and the recording of results
• System realisation – including annotated block and circuit diagrams; evidence of
layout planning; description of testing of complete systems and the recording of
results and user guide
• Evaluation – including a detailed evaluation of the system against the design
specification and suggestions for improvement.
and
• be presented in a logical order that is clear to read and understand
• contain an acknowledgement of all sources of information and help
• include photographs of the complete physical system.

Physical circuit
Construction of the system may be on prototype board, strip board or printed circuit
board. Whichever method of construction is chosen, the layout and mounting of
components and wiring should be neat and logical, assist the design, testing and
fault finding of the system. Pre constructed circuit boards such as PIC or Arduino
development boards are not acceptable as the final circuit.
Supervision
The task must be appropriately supervised to ensure that teachers are able to
confidently authenticate each learner’s work. Learners are allowed supervised
access to resources that may include information gathered outside supervised time.
Each learner must produce their system under 'immediate supervision'. This means
the system has to be produced either:
(i) with the simultaneous physical presence of the learner and the
supervisor,
or
(ii) remotely by means of simultaneous electronic communication.
In most cases supervision will be of the form described in (i), but in some
circumstances, for example if the learner is carrying out a specialist process away
from the centre, (ii) may be more appropriate.
