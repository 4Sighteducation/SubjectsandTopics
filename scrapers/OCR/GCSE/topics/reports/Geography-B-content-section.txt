SUBJECT CONTENT
The content of the specification is organised into three broad themes:
Theme 1: Changing Places - Changing Economies
Theme 2: Changing Environments
Theme 3: Environmental Challenges
Within each theme, learners should be encouraged to take an enquiry approach to a
range of contemporary geographical and environmental issues.
Learners should be given the opportunity to represent geographical data using a
range of cartographical and graphical techniques whilst exploring the content of each
component. They should be given the opportunity to analyse a variety of maps,
graphs, photographs and data sets. The range and extent of mathematical and
statistical techniques required by WJEC Eduqas GCSE Geography B is given in
Appendix A on pages 27-28 of the specification. These techniques will be assessed
across all three components. Fieldwork enquiry will be assessed in Component 3
only.

2.1 Component 1
Investigating Geographical Issues
Written examination: 1 hour 45 minutes
40% of qualification
96 marks (plus 4 marks for spelling, punctuation, grammar and use of specialist
terms)
Component 1 will assess content from all three compulsory themes of the
specification. Three structured questions, each of 32 marks, will include opportunities
for assessment using multiple choice, data response, short open response and
extended responses. At least one open response question will synthesise
knowledge and understanding of the UK as a whole.

A problem solving paper in three parts assessing content from across the three
themes described in Component 1 on pages 7 to 16:
Theme 1: Changing Places - Changing Economies
Theme 2: Changing Environments
Theme 3: Environmental Challenges
Part A will introduce an issue and set the geographical context (in terms of location

multiple choice, data response and short open responses.
Part B will outline a number of possible solutions to the issue. This structured
question will include opportunities for assessment using multiple choice, data

their choice following interpretation and analysis of the information and evaluation of
the issue. Assessment will be by longer open response.

2.3 Component 3
Applied Fieldwork Enquiry
Written examination: 1 hour 30 minutes
30% of qualification
72 marks (plus 4 marks for spelling, punctuation, grammar and use of specialist
terms)
Component 3 is a written examination in three parts.
Part A will assess approaches to fieldwork methodology, representation and analysis.
Part B will assess how fieldwork enquiry may be used to investigate geography's
conceptual frameworks.
Part C will assess the application of broad geographical concepts to a wider UK context
and assess the ability to make and justify a decision.
In order to prepare for this component, learners are expected to undertake two fieldwork
enquiries outside the classroom and school grounds, each in a contrasting
environment:
 In one environment the fieldwork should include one methodological approach. The
approach will be selected by WJEC from those listed in Table A on page 21.
 The second fieldwork experience should take place in a contrasting environment.
This fieldwork enquiry must be underpinned by geography's conceptual framework.
The approach will be selected by WJEC from those listed in Table B on pages 22-
23.
Teachers will be notified at least two years in advance which two approaches should be
taken by all centres in any given year. These approaches have been designed to allow
centres a wide range of choice of environment in which they can conduct fieldwork. They
should also allow centres to use familiar fieldwork locations that are known by them to be
safe. The sample assessment materials illustrate a cycle in which 'flows' is the
methodological approach selected from Table A and 'inequalities' is the geographical
conceptual framework selected from Table B.
Learners should have the opportunity to carry out all six of the stages of the enquiry
process when conducting fieldwork. The stages of the enquiry process are described
fully on page 19. It is recommended that learners spend about 18 guided learning hours
preparing for and consolidating their understanding of their fieldwork experiences.
Learners might prepare for their fieldwork by being given opportunities to:
 pose geographical questions
 research fieldwork methodologies
 consider sampling strategies
 design data collection sheets.
Learners might consolidate their understanding of fieldwork by being given opportunities
to:
 process data
 present their findings
 analyse patterns and trends
 draw conclusions
 consider limitations of the evidence / evaluate their fieldwork.

1.2 How is evidence collected? 1.2 Design fieldwork data collection sheets. Select specific
locations at which data can be collected. Establish control
groups. Justify sample size and sampling technique,
coverage to include sampling using random, systematic,
opportunistic and/or stratified techniques. Use fieldwork
equipment to obtain accurate and reliable results (for
example the use of clinometer or quadrats).
Collect data using quantitative and qualitative techniques.
Quantitative techniques should include those that
measure:
 flow (for example, discharge, infiltration, traffic)
 scale (for example, river width, pebble size, gradient)
 spatial pattern (for example, retail land use, sediment
sorting)
 temporal change (for example, temperature, rainfall,
pressure).
Qualitative techniques should include use of
questionnaires, bi-polar techniques and annotation of
photos/sketches.
Use secondary sources of evidence to include satellite
images, aerial and oblique photographs, large databases
(for example, National Statistics) and GIS (for example,
Environment Agency).

Approaches to fieldwork
Component 3 will assess different approaches to fieldwork in each examination series. In
order to provide learners with a relevant fieldwork experience, WJEC will provide one
methodological approach and a separate approach based on one conceptual framework
for fieldwork at least two years in advance of each assessment. The full list of
approaches is published in Table A on page 21 and Table B on pages 22-23 of the
specification. Centres will be free to conduct each fieldwork enquiry in any environment
but are reminded that learners should experience working in contrasting environments
outside of the classroom and school grounds i.e. if a coastal environment is chosen for
Table A then a contrasting environment should be chosen from Table B when
conducting the second fieldwork enquiry.
Learners should be given the opportunity to explore physical and human processes and
the interactions between them during their fieldwork experiences. They should be
involved in the collection of primary physical and human data (but these requirements
need not all be addressed in each piece of fieldwork).
Prior to each examination series, at least two years in advance of the assessment,
WJEC will publish the two approaches that centres should take during fieldwork:
 One of the methodological approaches in Table A will be selected by WJEC.
 One of the conceptual frameworks in Table B will be selected by WJEC.
The sample assessment materials illustrate a cycle in which 'flows' is the
methodological approach selected from Table A and 'inequalities' is the
conceptual framework selected from Table B.
Each centre must provide a fieldwork statement to WJEC that details the fieldwork
carried out by learners from the centre in each assessment cycle. Failure to provide a
fieldwork statement will be treated as malpractice and/or maladministration by WJEC.
Centres will be able to make their fieldwork statement by completing a form that will be
available to download from the GCSE Geography subject page of the Eduqas website.
Further details of fieldwork arrangements may be found in Section 3.2 on page 25.
