2 SUBJECT CONTENT
This specification promotes the integrated study of geology. It enables learners to
develop a broad range of skills and techniques in the areas of analysis and
interpretation of data, problem-solving and drawing conclusions. In addition, learners
are able to acquire data collection and interpretation skills in the field.
This specification covers all the requirements of GCSE Geology as outlined by the
Department for Education. The knowledge, understanding, skills and techniques are
set out in the two columns in the pages that follow. Learners should expect to be
assessed on the details of both columns. The square brackets [ ] within pages 7-20
provide further details of the extent of relevant content.
The subject content for GCSE Geology is assessed across two components. The
context in which the content is assessed across the two components differs.
 In Component 1, the whole of the content of the specification is assessed in a
theoretical way.
 In Component 2 there is a more practical approach, with the assessment
structured to investigate the geology of an area shown on an accompanying
simplified geological map. This assessment is wholly based on the area
covered by the geological map.
Component 1: Geological Principles
On-screen examination: 1 hour 15 minutes
50% of the qualification
80 marks
Component 2: Investigative Geology
Written examination: 1 hour 30 minutes
50% of the qualification
80 marks
A data sheet is used in both components. Learners should become familiar with the
use of this data sheet during their study of GCSE Geology.
WJEC offers full support to centres for the administration of Component 1, the on-
screen examination. All the necessary technical and practical advice is available from
WJEC to enable centres to oversee the management of this examination.
The content of the specification for WJEC Eduqas GCSE in Geology has a structure
based on four key ideas. These provide a framework for the learner to appreciate the
context and purpose of study of the content. The four key ideas are:
 rock exposures contain evidence of how rocks were formed and subsequently
deformed
 major concepts and techniques underpin our current understanding of the
Earth and its history

GCSE GEOLOGY 66
 comparisons of the Earth with other planetary bodies within the Solar System
provide evidence for the origin and evolution of both
 human interaction with the Earth can increase or reduce risk of Earth
hazards.
Fieldwork has long been an attractive aspect of the study of geology and has been
incorporated at the heart of this specification. Learners are required to undertake a
minimum of two days of work in the field in order to develop their field observation
and practical skills. Furthermore, to develop learners' problem solving skills, it is
expected that during at least one of these days they should have at least one
opportunity to carry out a directed investigation to answer a geological problem.
Examples of appropriate directed investigations include:
 an investigation to determine the environments of deposition of a sequence of
sedimentary rocks
 an investigation to determine the effects of tectonic stresses at a field location
 an investigation to determine the geological history of an area using field
observations.
This list is by no means exhaustive and centres should feel able to devise alternative
examples of directed investigations relevant to the field locations which are used.
Each centre must provide a fieldwork statement to WJEC that details the fieldwork
carried out by learners from the centre in each assessment cycle. Centres will be
able to make their fieldwork statement by completing the form that will be available to
download from the GCSE Geology subject page of the Eduqas website. The
fieldwork statement must be submitted to WJEC by 15 May of the year in which
candidates receive their award. Failure to provide a fieldwork statement will be
treated as malpractice and/or maladministration by WJEC.
Centres will be able to use the form to:
 confirm that each learner has been provided with opportunities to undertake
geological fieldwork on at least two occasions and in respect of each of
those opportunities:
 the date on which it was provided
 the number of learners who participated
 the location at which it was provided
 a brief description of the fieldwork undertaken
 confirm that each learner has been given a minimum of one opportunity to
carry out a directed investigation to answer a geological problem and
 give a brief description of any directed investigation(s).
Safety is paramount in the field and it is essential that all centres adhere to
‘The Geological Code of Conduct’ and the regulations of their centre
concerning off-site activities.
This specification encourages learners to take a practical approach to geology and
the skills required for this (see Appendix B) should be developed through regular
hands-on practical activities undertaken in the classroom and in the field.
Learners who follow this specification will develop a wide range of mathematical skills
as outlined in Appendix A. Calculators may be used in both components. Candidates
are responsible for making sure that their calculators meet the relevant regulations
for use in written examinations: information is found in the JCQ publications
Instructions for conducting examinations and Information for candidates for written
examinations.

Learners who follow this specification will also develop practical skills and techniques
as outlined in Appendix B. Problem-solving is at the heart of this specification and as
learners study the subject content they will also develop the skills outlined below.
Alongside knowledge of the subject content learners will be assessed on their ability
to:
 use theories, models and ideas to develop geological explanations and
present geological arguments
 use appropriate methodology to answer geological questions and solve
geological problems
 evaluate methodology, evidence and partial data sets, and resolve conflicting
evidence.
