SUBJECT CONTENT
Overview
The WJEC Eduqas specification is designed to introduce learners to the key areas of
the theoretical framework for studying media - media language, representation,
media industries and audiences – in relation to diverse examples from a wide range
of media forms: advertising and marketing, film, magazines, music video,
newspapers, online media, radio, television and video games. Through this study,
learners gain an understanding of the foundations of the subject, enabling them to
question and explore aspects of the media that may seem familiar and
straightforward from their existing experience in a critical way. This extends learners'
engagement with the media to the less familiar, including products from different
historical periods or those aimed at different audiences, providing rich and
challenging opportunities for interpretation and analysis. The study of relevant social,
cultural, political and historical contexts further enhances and deepens learners'
understanding of the media, as they explore key influences on the products studied.
This specification recognises the cross-media, multi-platform nature of the
contemporary media and the centrality of online and social media platforms in
distributing, accessing and participating in the media. In some instances, specific
forms are highlighted for detailed study, but this is in the context of their relationships
to other media forms and platforms, recognising the fluidity of these and emerging,
contemporary developments in the digital landscape.
Learning about the media involves both exploring and making media products and
these two activities are fundamentally related in the specification. Learners create a
media production for an intended audience, applying and developing their knowledge
and understanding of media language and representation in response to a choice of
briefs set by WJEC. This selection of forms allows learners to pursue their own
media interests and develop their practical skills in this component.
Theoretical Framework
This GCSE Media Studies specification is based on the theoretical framework for
exploring and creating media. The framework is based on four inter-related areas:
• media language: how the media through their forms, codes and conventions
communicate meanings
• representation: how the media portray events, issues, individuals and social
groups
• media industries: how the media industries' processes of production, distribution
and circulation affect media forms and platforms
• audiences: how media forms target, reach and address audiences, how
audiences interpret and respond to them, and how members of audiences
become producers themselves.
The framework provides a holistic and focused approach to interpreting and
analysing the media, which learners will develop progressively as they study the
three components.
The framework is set out in detail in components 1 and 2.

GCSE MEDIA STUDIES 7
Media Forms
Examples of all of the following media forms will be studied:
• advertising and marketing
• film
• magazines
• music video and online, social and participatory media studied through a single music topic
• newspapers
• radio
• television
• video games.
This will enable learners to develop knowledge and understanding of a broad range of media
forms and products, providing a comprehensive and balanced study of the media that
encompasses audio-visual, print-based and online forms, as well as exploring the inter-
relationships between them.
Media Products
Learners will study a wide range of media products, reflecting different forms, historical periods
and audiences. Most of these products are set by WJEC, but learners will also study additional
age appropriate products chosen by the teacher. All media products set by WJEC will be age-
appropriate. All set products will be reviewed periodically and changed where necessary for
other age-appropriate products.
Contexts of Media
In addition to the theoretical framework, learners will develop knowledge and understanding of
relevant contexts of media and their influence on media products and processes. The following
contexts will be considered to inform the study of the set products.
Historical Context
• how the product reflects the time in which it was made through its use of media language,
genre conventions, representations, themes, values, messages and viewpoints
• how the product reflects the time in which it was made through aspects of its production,
distribution, marketing, regulation, circulation and audience consumption
Social and Cultural Context
• how the product reflects the society and culture in which it was made through its
representations, themes, values, messages and viewpoints
• how the product is shaped or informed by particular cultural influences, such as genres,
styles, technologies and the work of other media producers
• how the product reflects the society and culture in which it was made through aspects of its
production, distribution, marketing, regulation, circulation and audience consumption
• how audience responses to and interpretations of media products may change over time
Political Context
• how the product reflects the political contexts in which it was made through its
representations, themes, values, messages and viewpoints
• how the product reflects the political contexts in which it was made through aspects of its
ownership and political viewpoint, production, distribution, marketing, regulation, circulation
and audience consumption.

GCSE MEDIA STUDIES 8
Skills
This specification enables learners to develop a range of skills in both analysing and creating
media products.
In analysing the media, learners will:
• demonstrate skills of enquiry, critical thinking and analysis
• analyse and compare how media products construct and communicate meaning and
generate intended interpretations and responses
• respond through discursive writing to show knowledge and understanding of media issues
• use specialist subject-specific terminology appropriately.
In creating a media production, learners will:
• develop practical and decision-making skills
• apply knowledge and understanding of media language and representation to a media
production
• use media language to express and communicate meaning to an intended audience.
Drawing Together Knowledge, Understanding and Skills
This specification provides opportunities for assessment which draws together knowledge,
understanding and skills from across the full course of study.
Learners will always be provided with the opportunity to draw together knowledge and
understanding from across the full course of study. This may be provided in Component 1,
Section B, or Component 2, Questions 2 or 4. Component 3 draws on the knowledge and
understanding of the theoretical framework of media and the analytical skills developed in
Components 1 and 2 through the practical application of knowledge and understanding in a
media production.

Overview
This component provides a foundation for analysing media products, introducing
learners to media language and representation through the study of print media forms.
Learners will develop their ability to analyse media language, representations and
meanings in a range of media products. In addition, learners will study products from
specific media industries and audiences to develop their knowledge and understanding
of those areas of the theoretical framework. Learners will also begin to explore how
media products reflect, and are influenced by, the social, cultural, historical and political
contexts in which they are produced. The following media forms will be studied.

Section A: Exploring Media Language and Representation
In this section, learners will analyse media language, considering how the selection and
combination of elements of media language influence and communicate meanings in
media products. Learners will also explore the concept of representation and relevant
representations of gender, ethnicity, age, issues and events in the media.
Learners will develop the ability to:
• analyse and compare how media products construct and communicate meanings
and generate intended interpretations and responses
• use relevant theories or theoretical perspectives and relevant subject-specific
terminology appropriately
• respond through discursive writing to show knowledge and understanding of media
issues
• construct and develop a sustained line of reasoning which is coherent, relevant,
substantiated and logically structured in an extended response.

Centres are responsible for accessing the set products for section B of this component.
The focus of section B is on the set products as examples of the related media industries and
audiences. For this section, learners should not engage in analysis of the textual features of the
set products, but should study them as examples of the relevant industry and audience issues
that they illustrate (see bullet points on media industries and audiences below). The online
presence of these media products provides a key way into both industry and audience issues.
Newspapers: The Sun
Learners should have knowledge and understanding of The Sun as an evolving media product
in terms of the relevant newspaper industry and audience issues it illustrates. In order to
develop this awareness, learners should consider one complete print edition of The Sun
chosen by the centre and selected key pages from The Sun website, including the
homepage and at least one other page. It is the responsibility of centres to monitor the content
of these products and ensure it is appropriate for their learners.
Radio: The Archers (for assessment in 2025 and 2026)
Learners should have knowledge and understanding of The Archers as an evolving media
product in terms of the relevant radio industry and audience issues it illustrates. To inform their
understanding of The Archers as an example of the contemporary radio industry and
contemporary radio audiences, learners should have an awareness of the historical significance
of the programme in terms of its evolution within the radio soap opera genre and how it has
changed in response to industry and audience demands. In order to develop this awareness,
learners should consider one complete episode of The Archers chosen by the centre and
selected key pages from The Archers website, including the homepage and at least one
other page.

GCSE MEDIA STUDIES 13
Radio: Desert Island Discs (for assessment from 2027 onwards)
Learners should have knowledge and understanding of Desert Island Discs as an evolving
media product in terms of the relevant radio industry and audience issues it illustrates. To
inform their understanding Desert Island Discs as an example of the contemporary radio
industry and contemporary radio audiences, learners should have an awareness of the
historical significance of the programme in terms of its evolution within the talk radio
programme genre and how it has changed in response to industry and audience demands. In
order to develop this awareness, learners should consider one complete episode of Desert
Island Discs chosen by the centre and selected key pages from Desert Island Discs
website, including the homepage and at least one other page.
Film: No Time to Die
Film must be studied in relation to media industries only. Learners may study No Time to Die
only in the context of cross-media study which explores the convergence of media platforms
and technologies and in the context of the study of media industries. In order to develop an
awareness of No Time to Die as part of the Bond franchise, learners should consider selected
key pages from the Official James Bond 007 website, including the homepage and at least
two other pages chosen by the centre. Extracts from the film must only be considered in
relation to the industry issues exemplified.
Video games: Fortnite
Learners should have knowledge and understanding of Fortnite as a contemporary online
game in terms of the relevant video games industry and audience issues it illustrates. In order
to develop this awareness, learners should consider selected key pages from the Fortnite
website, including the homepage and at least two other pages chosen by the centre. Extracts
from the game may be considered to illustrate industry and audience issues.
Learners will develop the ability to use relevant theories or theoretical perspectives and relevant
subject-specific terminology appropriately.

Assessment
Learners will be assessed on their use of relevant subject-specific terminology and relevant
theories or theoretical perspectives in this component.
Section A: Exploring Media Language and Representation (45 marks)
This section will assess knowledge and understanding of media language and representation in
relation to two of the media forms studied for this section: magazine front covers, film posters,
newspaper front pages, or print advertisements. Learners will analyse two types of resource
material:
• Set products: learners are required to refer to copies of the set products in the examination
in both questions one and two*
• Unseen resource: in question two, an unseen resource in the same media form as one of
the set products will be set for comparison.
* Copies of the relevant set products will be provided by WJEC Eduqas in the examination.
There will be two questions:
• Question 1 (15 marks) will assess media language and will require analysis of one of the
products set for study in this section. Learners refer to a copy of the product in the
examination. Reference to relevant contexts may be required.
• Question 2 (30 marks) will assess context and representation in relation to a different
media form from that assessed in question one.
• Part (a) (5 marks) will assess knowledge and understanding of context in relation to one
set product.
• Part (b) (25 marks) will require a comparison of an unseen resource with a set product
in the same media form. Learners refer to the unseen resource and a copy of the set
product in the examination. This question requires an extended response.
Section B: Exploring Media Industries and Audiences (35 marks)
This section will assess knowledge and understanding of media industries and audiences in
relation to any of the four forms studied for this section: film, newspapers, radio and video
games. The mark allocations for each question and part-question vary across examinations
series.
• Question 3 will be a stepped question assessing knowledge and understanding of media
industries in relation to one form studied.
• Question 4 will be a stepped question assessing knowledge and understanding of
audiences in relation to a different media form from that assessed in question 3.

2.2 Component 2
Understanding Media Forms and Products
Written examination: 1 hour 30 minutes
30% of qualification
60 marks
Overview
This component builds on the introduction to key areas of the theoretical framework
provided in Component 1. In Component 2, learners will gain a deeper knowledge and
understanding of media language and representation, as well as extending their
appreciation of these areas through the study of media industries and audiences.
Learners will also develop knowledge and understanding of how relevant social,
cultural, political and historical contexts of media influence media products.
In this component learners will explore particular media forms in depth through both of
the following topics:
1) Television: crime drama or sitcom
2) Music: music video and online media.
Learners should explore these topics through analysis of products set by WJEC.
Centres are responsible for accessing the products set for this component. The
television set products are available in disc format and via online distribution services.
Details of how to access the set products for the Music topic are provided below. The
music videos are also commercially available.
Both topics, including music video and online media within the music topic, must be
studied in-depth through all areas of the theoretical framework: media language,
representation, industry and audiences. The specific aspects to be covered are listed in
detail after the overview of each section.
Learners will develop the ability to:
• analyse and compare how media products construct and communicate meanings
and generate intended interpretations and responses
• use relevant theories or theoretical perspectives and relevant subject-specific
terminology
• respond through discursive writing to show knowledge and understanding of media
issues
• construct and develop a sustained line of reasoning which is coherent, relevant,
substantiated and logically structured in an extended response.
Section A: Television - Crime Drama or Sitcom
This section involves a detailed study of a specific television genre. Television genres
have distinct social and cultural significance in terms of their particular representations
of the world, their financial importance to the television industry, and their popularity with
television audiences. Each set option involves study of a complete episode from a
contemporary programme and one ten-minute extract from a programme produced in
the past. This is designed to enable learners to develop a knowledge and
understanding of how genres change over time. Learners will thus be able to explore
how media language, representations, messages and values, themes and issues in the
specified crime dramas and sitcoms reflect the key social, cultural, political and historical
contexts in which they are produced. The complete episodes set will also exemplify
industry issues and emerging, contemporary developments in television in the form of
online broadcasting. Both genre studies provide opportunities to address key aspects of
media audiences, including targeting, consumption and appeals.

Centres should be aware that the extract from Man Like Mobeen used in the examination will
be taken from BBC iPlayer. Centres are advised to use the BBC iPlayer version of the set
episode when teaching this set product.
Each set option involves study of a complete episode of a contemporary programme and one
ten-minute extract from an episode of a programme produced in the past. The extract is
selected by the centre, must be at least ten minutes in length and, in conjunction with the
complete episode, must enable learners to explore all aspects of the media theoretical
framework, which includes the following main areas:
• how the complete episode and the chosen extracts reflect the society and culture of the
time in which they were made
• what the complete episode and extract suggest about the representations of gender,
ethnicity and age
• key aspects of the broadcasting industry
• key audience issues.
The media theoretical framework is set out in detail at the end of the component.
Luther (for assessment in 2025 and 2026) allows learners to study an example of a
contemporary crime drama which incorporates ethnic diversity. It uses familiar crime
conventions to raise contemporary issues whilst at the same time extending and varying them.
It contrasts in its representation of gender in particular with The Sweeney, whose conventions
reflect a 1970s interest in blending action with police procedure. The two series demonstrate
different approaches to public service broadcasting, one publicly funded and the other
commercially funded.
Trigger Point (for assessment from 2027 onwards) allows learners to study an example of a
contemporary crime drama which incorporates gender and ethnic diversity. It uses familiar
crime conventions to raise contemporary issues whilst at the same time extending and varying
them. It contrasts in its representation of gender in particular with The Sweeney, whose
conventions reflect a 1970s interest in blending action with police procedure. Both series are
commercially funded, however the choice to simultaneously premiere Trigger Point on ITV and
ITVX reflects the continued growth of online streaming services.
The sitcom option offers the opportunity to study a contemporary example of the sitcom genre.
Man Like Mobeen and Modern Family are award-winning television programmes that offer a
range of interesting representations and play on stereotypes of age, gender and ethnicity.
Friends uses sitcom conventions in a typical way and represents a conservative representation
of the diversity of US society whilst being slightly more challenging in its representation of
gender. The productions reflect different broadcasting contexts: a 'home-grown' British
production initially created for the BBC Three digital channel, now returned to linear television
(Man Like Mobeen), an American production licensed to Netflix (Modern Family), and a
terrestrial broadcaster purchasing an American series for broadcast (Friends). These series
reflect the continued growth of online streaming services and global, on-demand consumption
by audiences.

Section B: Music - Music Video and Online Media
Section B requires a detailed study of music through focusing on two contemporary music
videos and the online, social and participatory media surrounding the artists. In addition,
learners study one music video from the past to enable learners to develop their understanding
of media language and of how representations reflect, and are influenced by, relevant contexts.
Music video Areas to be studied

Social and participatory media
The role of social and participatory media in relation to an artist's
website will be studied. Reference should be made to at least two
social and participatory media platforms.
Note: all music videos and websites are considered age-appropriate but online, social and participatory
media are constantly changing and it is impossible to fully predict future content. It is the centre's
responsibility to monitor and select appropriate content for their teaching circumstances and to study
this at an appropriate point during the course.* The song lyrics for Good as Hell and Superheroes
contain mild expletives. The primary emphasis is on studying representation and media language
(camera, editing, visual codes etc.) within the music videos and there is no explicit requirement to study
the lyrics themselves. If the lyrics are studied, teachers can provide ‘clean’ versions with expletives
removed.
Alternative options for both female and male artists are available to provide a route through the
specification for any learners for whom content is inappropriate.

GCSE MEDIA STUDIES 20
The contemporary media industries are increasingly dependent on each other for the
production, distribution and circulation of their products. This is particularly evident in the music
industry, where forms such as the music video have developed both as products popular with
audiences and as marketing. Learners will also be able to explore how the music industry uses
conventional online forms such as websites as well as social and participatory media. This will
enable learners to explore a range of industry and audience issues.
Websites, by their very nature, are dynamic and updated to respond to industry and audience
needs. Learners are required to study the following elements of their chosen websites:
• the design of the home page, including its use of images and topical material
• links to other content, including audio-visual material and music videos
• interactive links, including to social and participatory media.
For this component, learners must develop their knowledge and understanding of all aspects of
the theoretical framework as follows:
Media Language Representation
• the various forms of media language • the ways in which the media re-present
used to create and communicate (rather than simply present) the world, and
meanings in media products

GCSE MEDIA STUDIES 22
Assessment
Learners will be assessed on their use of relevant subject-specific terminology and relevant
theories or theoretical perspectives in this component.
This component assesses all areas of the theoretical framework and contexts of the media in
relation to television and music.
Section A: Television (30 marks)
A television resource* will be set for this examination. One extract will be set from Luther (in
2025 and 2026) or Trigger Point (from 2027 onwards), one from Man Like Mobeen, and one
from Modern Family, to be screened as appropriate by the centre.
Question 1 (20 marks) will assess the ability to analyse either media language or
representation in relation to the extract set and will be in two parts. Part (a) will assess the
ability to analyse media products. Part (b) will assess the ability to analyse and make
judgements and draw conclusions. Reference to relevant contexts may be required.
Question 2 (10 marks) will assess knowledge and understanding of media industries,
audiences or media contexts.
*Extracts from each of the set episodes of Luther (in 2025 and 2026) or Trigger Point (from
2027 onwards), Man Like Mobeen and Modern Family will be made available to centres as an
MP4 resource, downloadable through our Portal site. The extract will be approximately three
minutes in length and will be played twice, with a six-minute break for making notes between
each viewing. Learners will be given two minutes to read the questions in Section A before the
extract is shown.
Section B: Music (music videos and online media) (30 marks)
Question 3 (20 marks) will assess the ability to make judgements and draw conclusions
through an analysis of the set media products in terms of either media language or
representation. Reference to relevant contexts may be required.
Question 4 (10 marks) will assess knowledge and understanding of media industries,
audiences or media contexts.

Creating Media Products
Non-exam assessment: internally assessed and externally moderated by WJEC Eduqas
30% of qualification
60 marks
Content
This component draws together knowledge and understanding of the media theoretical
framework gained throughout their course by requiring learners to apply their knowledge
and understanding of the media synoptically through practical production. In
Components 1 and 2, learners gain a detailed understanding of media language,
representation and audience in relation to a range of media forms. In this component,
learners must apply their knowledge and understanding of media language and
representation to an individual media production for an intended audience in response
to a choice of briefs set by WJEC Eduqas.
The set production briefs will change every year, requiring learners to create a
production in a different genre/style and/or for a different intended audience. The
briefs will be released annually on 1 March in the year prior to assessment, and will be
published on the WJEC Eduqas website. Task-specific indicative content will be
issued each year with the non-exam assessment briefs.
Production briefs will always be set in the following media forms: television, magazines,
film marketing and music marketing. The briefs will always specify the intended target
audience, as well as other key requirements such as genre/style. Learners will develop
a response to their chosen brief by creating a production aimed at the specified intended
audience.
The following media forms and frameworks will form the basis of all set briefs:
Television
• Create a sequence from a new television programme or a website* to promote a
new television programme.
Advertising and Marketing: Music
• Create a music video or a website* to promote a new artist/band.
Advertising and Marketing: Film
• Print-based marketing material for a new film.
Magazines
• Create a new print or online magazine.
In order to ensure that an undue amount of time is not spent on the production, all
phases of the production – aims, research and planning and the production itself –
should be completed over a period of no longer than twelve weeks.
*Website production
Learners are not required to create websites through programming languages such as
HTML. It is acceptable for learners to use web design software or templates in the
online options. However, learners must be responsible for the design of the website and
all content (such as language, images, audio-visual material) must be original.
Learners must acknowledge any software or templates which have been used on the
appropriate cover sheet.

GCSE MEDIA STUDIES 24
Statement of Aims
Learners must complete a brief outline of their aims for the media production that must be
submitted with the production. This will be assessed with the production and will enable
learners to explain the ways in which they will apply knowledge and understanding of media
language and representation to the production and target the intended audience. This is a
compulsory element of the non-exam assessment and learners must complete the statement of
aims in Section B of the cover sheet using approximately 250 words. A template is provided on
the WJEC Eduqas website for guidance.
Research and Planning
Learners will undertake preparatory work to develop their understanding of media language,
representation and audience in relation to their intended production that must be guided,
monitored and authenticated by the teacher. This research and planning will not be assessed
separately but learners will be assessed on the production outcomes that result from these
stages.
The research may include:
• analysis of the use of media language in similar media products to identify the codes and
conventions of the particular genres and forms
• analysis should focus on how specific techniques such as layout and composition,
camerawork, editing and sound are used to create meaning, and the way in which
representations of events, issues, individuals and social groups (as appropriate) are
constructed, considering how choice of elements of media language influences meaning
• research into how media products are aimed at and target audiences, including analysis of
the techniques used to appeal to and engage an intended audience
• secondary research – internet-based research appropriate to GCSE into audiences to
develop understanding and support analysis
• primary audience research such as focus groups prior to completion of production work.
Learners will also plan their production work carefully to ensure that they apply their
understanding of media language and representation to the media production. The planning
work may include:
• a pitch or treatment for the production
• a project plan including a timeline and the planned use of, for example, resources or
equipment
• planning documents appropriate to the forms/products undertaken such as a step outline, a
shot list, a storyboard, a script, draft designs, mock-ups of composition and layout.

GCSE MEDIA STUDIES 25
Assessment
Component 3 is internally assessed and externally moderated. The total number of marks
available is 60:
• 10 marks for the statement of aims
• 20 marks for creating a media product that meets the requirements of the set brief
• 30 marks for creating a media product which uses media language to communicate
meanings and construct representations.
The assessment of this component will be based on the statement of aims and the media
production. Learners who do not submit a production will be awarded zero marks for the
statement of aims.
Learners are advised to consider the requirements of the marking criteria (Appendix A) when
planning and creating their production. Learners will be assessed on their ability to create a
production for an intended audience by applying their knowledge and understanding of media
language and representation to the production work in the following ways:
• responding to the requirements of the brief and completing all tasks detailed in the chosen
set brief
• appealing to, and engaging, the intended target audience detailed in the brief through the
use of, for example, genre conventions and representations to communicate meanings to
the intended audience
• applying knowledge and understanding of media language by using appropriate codes and
conventions of the genre/style/form
• applying knowledge and understanding of representations of particular events/
issues/groups and individuals appropriate to the brief, by using appropriate representational
devices, showing understanding of how meanings are created.
Assessment Evidence and Authentication
Every learner must complete a cover sheet to be found on the WJEC Eduqas website. This
form must be signed by both the teacher and the learner to authenticate the work undertaken.
Work should be reviewed for authentication purposes at three key stages of the process:
• when the planning stage is completed
• at a suitable point during the production process e.g. when footage has been shot for
an audio-visual production or a full draft completed for a print or online production,
including main images/text
• when the production is completed.
At each authenticating stage, teachers must sign and date the appropriate section of the
cover sheet. It is important that the completion of the production is rigorously monitored by
centres to ensure that learners' work is their own. Teachers must sign the completed cover
sheet to validate the authenticit
