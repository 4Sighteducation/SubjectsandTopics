1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Aims and objectives
The WJEC Eduqas GCSE in Drama offers a broad and coherent course of study
which enables learners to:
• apply knowledge and understanding when making, performing and
responding to drama
• explore performance texts, understanding their social, cultural and historical
context including the theatrical conventions of the period in which they were
created
• develop a range of theatrical skills and apply them to create performances
• work collaboratively to generate, develop and communicate ideas
• develop as creative, effective, independent and reflective learners able to
make informed choices in process and performance
• contribute as an individual to a theatrical performance
• reflect on and evaluate their own work and that of others
• develop an awareness and understanding of the roles and processes
undertaken in contemporary professional theatre practice
• adopt safe working practices.
The WJEC Eduqas GCSE in Drama is an exciting, inspiring and practical course.
The specification promotes involvement in and enjoyment of drama, as performers
and/or designers. Additionally it provides opportunities to attend live theatre
performances and to develop skills as informed and thoughtful audience members.
Through following this specification, learners will be given opportunities to participate
in and interpret their own and others' drama. Learners have the option to work
practically as performers and/or designers in Components 1 and 2.
Learners will investigate a practitioner or genre of drama, work collaboratively to
develop ideas to communicate meaning and experiment with dramatic conventions,
forms and techniques to produce and realise a piece of original theatre. They will
also have the opportunity to participate in the performance of an extract from a play
text. Learners will demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of drama,
including their ability to interpret texts for performance, in a written examination.
However, in preparation for this assessment, learners are encouraged to study their
chosen text practically as a performer, designer and director.

GCSE DRAMA 4
1.2 Prior learning and progression
There are no previous learning requirements for this specification. Any requirements
set for entry to a course based on this specification are at the school/college’s
discretion.
This specification builds on subject content which is typically taught at key stage 3
and provides a suitable foundation for the study of drama at either AS or A level. In
addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of
study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.
1.3 Equality and fair access
This specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to achieve
because they have a particular protected characteristic.
The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.
The specification has been discussed with groups who represent the interests of a
diverse range of learners, and the specification will be kept under review.
Reasonable adjustments are made for certain learners in order to enable them to
access the assessments (e.g. candidates are allowed access to a Sign Language
Interpreter, using British Sign Language). Information on reasonable adjustments is
found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ):
Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments and Special Consideration:
General and Vocational Qualifications.
This document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk). As a consequence
of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will have a complete
barrier to any part of the assessment.

2. SUBJECT CONTENT
The WJEC Eduqas GCSE Drama specification is designed to give learners a broad
and balanced experience of drama. The specification is designed to integrate
knowledge and understanding of how drama and theatre is developed and performed
across a range of dramatic activities. Across the three components learners will
study:
• one complete performance text
• two extracts from a second contrasting performance text placed within the
context of the whole text
• either the techniques of an influential theatre practitioner or the
characteristics of a genre of drama.
Learners will have the opportunity to work practically as designers and/or performers
on:
• one devised performance using the techniques or characteristics of their
chosen theatre practitioner or genre
• one performance based on the second contrasting performance text using
sections of text from the two extracts.
In Components 1 and 2, learners are given the opportunity to develop acting and/or
design skills as appropriate to their interests and facilities available in the centre.
Learners may choose the same skill for each component, or a different skill for each
component. Learners must choose from the list below:
• performing
• lighting design
• sound design
• set design (including props)
• costume design (including hair and make-up).
Learners should adopt safe working practices in all components as directed by the
centre.
In addition to their own theatre making, learners must also know and understand the
roles of performer, designer and director, and participate in theatre as an audience
member.

GCSE DRAMA 6
2.1 Component 1
Devising Theatre
Non-exam assessment: internally assessed, externally moderated
40% of qualification
60 marks
Learners are required to devise a piece of original theatre in response to a stimulus,
using either the techniques of an influential theatre practitioner or the characteristics
of a genre of drama.
40% of qualification
Group arrangements
Learners choose to be assessed on either acting or design. Learners choosing
design must work with a group of actors. It is not necessary for all acting groups to
work with designers. Learners choosing design must pick one option from the list
below:
• lighting design
• sound design
• set design (including props)
• costume design (including hair and make-up).
Learners work in groups of between two and five actors. Each group may have up to
four designers, each offering a different design skill. Designers must contribute fully
to the creation of the piece of theatre. Centres must give careful consideration to the
size of groups and choice of genre or practitioner, ensuring that all learners, including
designers, are able to fully demonstrate their skill. Centres should also ensure that
the group sizes and the choice of practitioner or genre allow learners to adopt safe
working practices.
This component involves devising and realising work for performance and evaluating
the final piece of theatre.
1. Devising
Learners choose one stimulus from a list of four supplied annually by WJEC.
There are example stimulus materials in Appendix A. The stimulus materials
will always consist of:
• a quotation
• a song
• a picture
• a concept or statement.
Learners devise a piece of theatre in response to the stimulus which
demonstrates either the techniques of a theatre practitioner or the dramatic
characteristics of a specific genre of the learner's choice. Learners create and
develop ideas to communicate meaning to an audience by:
• researching and developing ideas using the techniques or
characteristics of the practitioner or genre
• rehearsing, amending and refining the work in progress.
© WJEC CBAC Ltd.
GCSE DRAMA 7
All learners should consider the following when devising their piece of theatre:
• structure
• theme/plot
• form and style
• language/dialogue.
Learners choosing performing should consider how meaning is
communicated through the following, as appropriate to the piece of theatre:
• performance conventions
• use of space and spatial relationships on stage, including the choice
of stage (e.g., proscenium arch, theatre in round, traverse or thrust)
• relationships between performers and audience
• design elements including lighting, sound, set and costume
• the physical and vocal interpretation of character.
Learners choosing design should consider how meaning is communicated
through the following, as appropriate to the piece of theatre:
• Lighting design
o intensity/strength
o focus
o angle
o special effects
o colour
o gobos
o types of lantern
• Sound design
o music
o sound effects
o live sounds
o recorded sounds
o volume
o reverb/echo
o sound sources including position on stage
o amplification
• Set design (including props)
o choice of stage
o backdrop/cyclorama
o set dressing
o props
o furniture
o colour
o use of space
o entrances and exits
o sight lines
• Costume design (including hair and make-up)
o choice and use of materials/fabrics
o garments
o hairstyles
o wigs
o make-up
o accessories
o colour/pattern.

GCSE DRAMA 8
Teachers may provide guidance to candidates in relation to the research, cre-
ation, development, amendment and refinement of their devised performance
or design. Section 3.2 of this specification outlines the guidance
permitted.
Learners must produce a portfolio of supporting evidence which demonstrates
the research, creation and development of ideas. This is a working record and
therefore should be compiled during the process and edited to ensure an
appropriate focus.
The evidence should focus on three stages which are significant to the
development of the devised piece of theatre. The three stages should
demonstrate:
1. how ideas have been researched, created and developed in response
to the chosen stimulus
2. how ideas from the chosen practitioner/genre have been incorporated
in the piece to communicate meaning
3. how ideas have been developed, amended and refined during the
development of the devised piece.
For each stage, candidates must provide illustrative material (as listed below)
and a commentary, which may include annotations on the illustrative material.
The commentary for each stage should be approximately 250 – 300 words
and total 750 to 900 words for the complete portfolio.
Candidates may also produce their portfolio as a suitably edited blog
(between 750 and 900 words), as an audio-visual recording, including the
illustrative material, or an audio commentary on the illustrative material.
Audio and audio-visual portfolios should be between four and seven minutes.
Illustrative material may include any of the following:
• sketches
• photographs
• ground plans
• diagrams
• storyboards
• mood boards
• sections of script
• digital media, including brief recordings of sections of a rehearsal or
material appropriate to the skill area, e.g., sound clips. These should
be no longer than one minute.
The portfolio is intended to highlight the creative and developmental process
of devising the piece of theatre. It is not intended to be a full record of the
rehearsal period, and learners should choose carefully the evidence which
best supports the three significant stages of development of their piece of
theatre.
2. Realising
Learners realise their piece of theatre. The length of the piece will depend on
the number of actors in the group and should be as follows:
Group of two actors: 5-10 minutes
Group of three actors: 7-12 minutes
Group of four actors: 9-14 minutes
Group of five actors: 11-16 minutes.
© WJEC CBAC Ltd.
GCSE DRAMA 9
Each actor must interact with other performers and/or the audience for a
minimum of five minutes.
Designers must realise their design in performance. However, as it is the
design itself which is assessed, the technical equipment may be operated by
someone else.
The following is a list of minimum requirements for the realisation of each
design option.
Lighting design
• 5 different states using, for example, different:
o colours
o angles
o strengths
o specials
Sound design
• 5 different cues using, for example:
o recorded sound effects
o effects used at source
o atmospheric sound effects
o specials
Set design (including props)
• set created for performance of one group
• set dressed appropriately
• props for the performance of chosen group
Costume design (including hair and make-up)
• 2 full costumes, hair and make-up for 2 different characters
Learners choosing design must also, as part of the supporting evidence,
submit the following evidence of the final design, as appropriate to the skill
(this is not an exhaustive list).
Lighting design
• cue sheets
• lighting plot
Sound design
• cue sheets
• sound plot
Set design (including props)
• set model
• ground plan
• photographs of set
Costume design (including hair and make-up)
• final design sketches/photographs of costume, hair and make-up

GCSE DRAMA 10
3. Evaluating
Learners evaluate the final performance or design under supervised
conditions. Learners will indicate their chosen stimulus and chosen
practitioner or genre. There will be three main sections to the evaluation in
which learners:
1. analyse and evaluate either their interpretation of character/role or
their realisation of design in the final performance.
2. analyse and evaluate how either their own performance skills or their
own design skills contributed to the effectiveness of the final
performance
3. analyse and evaluate their individual contribution to the final
performance, including how effectively they fulfilled their initial aims
and objectives (referring back to stimulus and practitioner/genre).
Learners will have 1 hour 30 minutes to complete the evaluation.
Learners may have access to two sides of A4 in bullet point notes when
writing the evaluation. The notes must be handed in with the evaluation.
Assessment
This component assesses:
• Devising: create and develop ideas to communicate meaning for
performance (AO1, 30 marks). This is assessed through the portfolio
of supporting evidence.
• Realising: apply theatrical skills to realise artistic intentions (AO2, 15
marks). This is assessed through the performance or design (realised
in performance).
• Evaluating: analyse and evaluate their own work (AO4, 15 marks).
This is assessed through a written evaluation completed under
supervised conditions.
Each learner must produce the following:
1. a performance or design, recorded audio-visually from the audience
perspective1
2. a portfolio of supporting evidence
3. an evaluation.
Additional information about arrangements for non-exam assessment can be
found in section 3.2. Guidance on approaches to, and assessment of, this
component can be found in appendix A. This includes:
• a list of sample stimulus materials
• a list of suitable practitioners and genres
• assessment grids for Component 1
• guidance on the assessment of Component 1.
1 One recording of each group piece is required. It is not necessary to provide a recording for each individual
learner. You must upload learners' work via the WJEC e-portfolio system. Any large artefacts, such as a costume
or set model should be photographed or filmed. The artefact itself should be kept in the centre and will be
requested if necessary.

GCSE DRAMA 11
2.2 Component 2
Performing from a Text
Non-exam assessment: externally assessed by a visiting examiner
20% of qualification
60 marks
Learners are required to participate in a performance from a text. Learners will gain a
deeper understanding of how to interpret a text for performance and realise artistic
intentions.
Group arrangements
Learners may choose to be assessed on either acting or design. Learners are
assessed on the final performance or design only. Learners choosing design must
work with a group of actors. It is not necessary for all acting groups to work with
designers. Learners choosing design must pick one option from the list below:
• lighting design
• sound design
• set design (including props)
• costume design (including hair and make-up).
Learners work in groups of between two and four actors. Each performance may
have up to two designers, each offering a different design skill. Designers must
contribute fully to the creation of the piece of theatre. Centres must give careful
consideration to the size of groups and the choice of text, ensuring that all learners,
including designers, are able to fully demonstrate their skill. Centres should also
ensure that the group sizes and choice of texts allow learners to adopt safe working
practices.
Selecting a text for performance
Learners are required to study two 10 minute extracts, within the context of the whole
text, from one performance text of their own choice. The extracts studied must be
key extracts from the text selected for study: they must each represent a scene or
moment that is significant to the text as a whole. Texts must be studied to gain a
practical understanding of drama. A list of suitable texts is provided in Appendix B.
However, learners may choose a different text. The text must be one which has been
professionally commissioned and/or professionally produced and must contrast with
the text chosen for Component 3 to enable learners to gain a broad and varied
experience of drama at GCSE. The criteria for selecting appropriately contrasting
texts for Component 2 and Component 3 are listed below.
• The texts must be written by different playwrights.
• The texts must be written in historically different time periods (as indicated in
the table on page 12).
• The texts must contrast in theme (as indicated in the table on page 12).

GCSE DRAMA 12
Please see the table below for playwrights, dates written and themes which must be
avoided when selecting texts for Component 2.
Component 3 text Selection of Component 2 text

(2001) Time period: 1990 - 2010
Theme: The effects of war and separation
I Love You Mum – I Playwright: Mark Wheeller
Promise I Won’t Die Time period: 2000 - 2020
(2014) Theme: Risks of drugs, peer pressure and the impact of
loss
The IT Playwright: Vivienne Franzmann.
(2020) Time period: 2010 onwards
Theme: The effects of social anxiety on young people
It is not necessary for all learners in the teaching group to study extracts from the
same performance text. Centres should encourage learners to choose texts which
suit their interests and abilities, whilst ensuring a broad and balanced experience of
drama. Centres should equally consider the combinations of learners within each
teaching group when selecting appropriate texts. As with the texts listed in Appendix
B, texts must be chosen to allow performers to demonstrate a consistency and/or
development of character, and design candidates to employ a range of techniques to
create an appropriate mood and atmosphere across the two extracts.
Centres should note that where the criteria for selecting appropriately contrasting
texts are not adhered to, a penalty will be applied (see section 3.2).
This component consists of preparing for performance and realising.
1. Preparing for performance
Learners create a performance or design using sections of text from both of the 10
minute extracts. Learners must demonstrate an understanding of the playwright's
intentions when interpreting the text for performance. Learners must consider the
following when preparing their performance or design.
• The performance need not use the full 20 minutes studied (see 'Realising'
below for performance times) but must demonstrate understanding of both
extracts.
© WJEC CBAC Ltd.
GCSE DRAMA 13
• The performance must contain an appropriate amount of text from each 10
minute extract to make a coherent interpretation in performance. This may
be split equally between the two extracts or in any other way appropriate to
the text and the performance. For example, in a 12 minute performance it
might be desirable to have one 8 minute section followed by 4 minutes
from later in the text to bring it to a conclusion. Or conversely, it might be
preferable to have a 3 minute introductory section followed by 9 minutes
from later in the text.
• The text may be edited to create one coherent interpretation, but must not
contain any additional dialogue or characters. The group may have
additional non-assessed supporting actors with small roles where
necessary.
• The performance may contain monologues but cannot consist solely of
monologues. For example, the piece could contain a duologue taken from
one 10 minute extract plus two monologues from two different 10 minute
extracts from the same text. Or, in a group of four, learners may select one
extract for four actors and two separate extracts for two groups of two
actors.
• Where an acting group is using more than two 10 minute extracts, as
exemplified above, learners opting for design must create a design for the
whole piece.
• Designs should complement the text and also show consistency and/or
progression in the content. For example, a full costume change might not
be necessary, but the addition of an item to show a change in
circumstance/time might well be appropriate; a lighting designer might
change the colour to reflect a different time of day; a sound designer might
modify the settings to reflect a change of mood and a set designer might
alter small details to indicate the passing of time.
• The performance or design must show consistency and/or development of
character/theme, as appropriate to the role, between the two extracts.
• It is not advisable to play a character of a different gender in a naturalistic
style, e.g. for a boy to play the part of a mother, as this may disadvantage
the learner in the application of physical and vocal skills. However, it is
permitted to change the gender of a character, where this doesn't change
the meaning of the text. Multi-roling, where this is a feature of the style of
the piece, may also be used.
• Teachers may provide guidance to candidates in relation to their
performance or design. Section 3.2 of this specification outlines the
guidance permitted.
2. Realising
The piece must be performed live for a visiting examiner on a date agreed
with the centre between January and May. The length of the piece will
depend on the number of actors in the group and should be as follows:
Group of two actors: 5-10 minutes
Group of three actors: 7-12 minutes
Group of four actors: 9-14 minutes.
Each actor must interact with other performers and/or the audience for a
minimum of five minutes.
© WJEC CBAC Ltd.
GCSE DRAMA 14
Designers must realise their design in performance. However, as it is the
design itself which is assessed, the technical equipment may be operated by
someone else.
The following is a list of minimum requirements for the realisation of each
design skill.
Lighting design
• 4 different states using, for example, different:
o colours
o angles
o strengths
o specials.
Sound design
• 4 different cues using, for example:
o recorded sound effects
o effects used at source
o atmospheric sound effects
o specials.
Set design
• set created for performance of one group
• set dressed appropriately
• props for the performance of chosen group
Costume design (including hair and make-up)
• 1 full costume, hair and make-up for 1 character.
© WJEC CBAC Ltd.
GCSE DRAMA 15
Assessment
This component assesses the final realisation only (AO2, 60 marks). In this
component learners must demonstrate the ability to:
• apply performing or design skills to realise artistic intentions in live
performance
• interpret their chosen text
• contribute as an individual to the live performance.
Evidence
1. Each learner must submit to the examiner a brief account of
approximately 150 words (i.e. approximately half a side of A4)
outlining their artistic intentions for the piece. This should include:
• for performance candidates, a brief account of how they aim to
interpret their chosen character
• for design candidates, a brief account of how they aim to interpret
the chosen scene(s) through design
• for all candidates, a brief indication of how the 20 minutes of text
studied for the component was edited to create the final
performance.
This outline of artistic intentions is not assessed but is necessary to
assist the examiner in assessing the realisation of artistic intentions.
A form for this purpose, Component 2: Artistic Intentions, will be made
available on WJEC's website.
2. The centre must record all the live performances given in front of the
visiting examiner from the audience perspective.2 The recording must
be submitted to WJEC within two weeks of the assessment.
Additional information about arrangements for non-exam assessment can be
found in section 3.2. The assessment grids for Component 2 and a list of
suitable texts for study can be found in Appendix B.
2 One recording of each group piece is required. It is not necessary to provide a recording for each individual
learner. You must upload learners' work via the WJEC e-portfolio system.

2.3 Component 3
Interpreting Theatre
Written examination: 1 hour 30 minutes
40% of qualification
60 marks
This component requires learners to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding
of how drama and theatre is developed and performed through the study of a
performance text and through responding to live theatre.
Section A
Centres are reminded that the texts chosen for Components 2 and Component 3
must be contrasting. The criteria for selecting appropriately contrasting texts for Com-
ponent 2 and Component 3 are listed below.
• The texts must be written by different playwrights.
• The texts must be written in historically different time periods.
• The texts must contrast in theme.
Please see the table in Section 2.2 for confirmation of these details.
Learners will study one complete performance text from the list below. It is expected
that learners will approach the study of the text practically as an actor, designer and
director. A clean copy (no annotation) of the chosen set text must be taken into the
examination.
The following texts will be used for assessment from 2024 onwards:
1. Macbeth William Shakespeare (Wordsworth Classics)
2. An Inspector Calls J.B. Priestley (Heinemann)
3. Find Me Olwen Wymark (Samuel French)
4. Noughts & Crosses Malorie Blackman adapted by Sabrina Mahfouz (NHB)
5. Refugee Boy Benjamin Zephaniah adapted by Lemn Sissay (Bloomsbury)
6. I Love You Mum – I Promise I Won’t Die Mark Wheeler (Bloomsbury)
7. The IT Vivienne Franzmann (NHB)
Centres may select any edition of a set text for study, regardless of ISBN, but it is im-
portant to remember that there may be non-consequential language variances be-
tween editions. Centres must ensure that the version of the play studied is distributed
by the publisher and written by the individual(s) listed in the specification.
Learners must consider how the text is constructed and how performances create
meaning through:
• the characteristics of the performance text, including
o genre
o structure
o character (including interpretation and function within an extract)
o form and style
o language/dialogue
o stage directions
• the social, historical and cultural context including the theatrical conventions of
the period in which the performance text was created
• how meaning is interpreted and communicated through
o performance conventions
© WJEC CBAC Ltd.
GCSE DRAMA 17
o use of performance space and spatial relationships on stage, including the
impact of different stages (proscenium arch, theatre in round, traverse and
thrust) on at least one scene
o relationships between performer and audience
o the design of lighting, sound, set (including props) and costume, hair and
make-up
o the actor's vocal and physical interpretation of character.
Section B
Learners are required to analyse and evaluate one piece of live theatre viewed
during the course. It is recommended that learners take the opportunity to view a
professional full length theatre production. However, the work of amateurs can be
used, but not the work of peers. It is also recommended that learners see more than
one live performance when preparing for this assessment to allow sufficient scope for
answering on a variety of aspects during the examination. The live theatre
production chosen for viewing must not be the text studied in Section A of this
component.
Centres are required to provide a written statement confirming that reasonable steps
have been taken to ensure that each learner at the centre has experienced live
performance, where they were a member of the audience in the same performance
space as the performers, as part of their studies for WJEC Eduqas GCSE (9-1)
Drama. A form for this purpose is available on the WJEC Eduqas website and must
be submitted by 31 May in the year of the award.
Learners will be expected to analyse and evaluate how meaning is communicated
through the role of theatre makers in contemporary professional performance.
Learners must consider the role of the:
• actor
o interpretation of character
o character interaction
o vocal skills
o movement skills
• designer
o creation of mood and atmosphere
o use of performance space
o lighting
o sound
o set and props
o costume and make-up
• director
o interpretation and style
o performance conventions
o spatial relationships on stage
o relationship between performer and audience
• reaction and response
o individual
o audience.
