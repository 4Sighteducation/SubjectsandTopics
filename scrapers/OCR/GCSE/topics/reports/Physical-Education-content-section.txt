2 SUBJECT CONTENT
The subject content focuses on five key areas:
1. Health, training and exercise
2. Exercise physiology
3. Movement analysis
4. Psychology of sport and physical activity
5. Socio-cultural issues in physical activity and sport
All of the subject content can be assessed in Component 1 as part of the written

The active participant in physical education
Non-exam assessment
40% of qualification
80 marks
Learners will be assessed in three different activities in the role of player/performer in at
least one individual and one team sport (30%) from the lists of activities in Appendix B.
The list of activities is a full and complete list of all available activities as stipulated by the
Department for Education. Learners will also be assessed through an analysis and
evaluation of their performance in one of their chosen activities (10%).
The assessment grids for both the practical performance and the written analysis and
evaluation can be found in Appendix A.
The generic performance skills and amplification for the practical activities are set out in
the columns below.
Practical performance skills

In both individual and team Learners should be able to:
activities, learners should
demonstrate:
Skills and techniques Apply the appropriate skills and techniques to the
activity in demanding situations such as full games.
Decision making skills Apply appropriate decision making and strategies in
demanding situations such as full games.
In creative activities such as dance and gymnastics

Performance analysis and evaluation
Learners must design a personal training programme with the aim of providing
recommendations to improve performance in one of the practical activities in which
they were assessed.
Learners will not be assessed on whether or not improvements have occurred.
Learners must include appropriate theoretical content in their personal performance
analysis and evaluation. Learners must collect, present, analyse and evaluate
appropriate data for the personal performance analysis.
It is recommended that the programme be a minimum of 8 weeks duration.
The written evidence may be submitted electronically or as a paper version and must
include evidence of the following:
• A self-analysis of current performance levels in one of the chosen practical
activities.
• A plan of the training programme with a clear objective
• Completion and monitoring of the training programme
• An evaluation of the training programme and the results
• Recommendations for improvements to personal performance
The analysis and evaluation has a total of 20 marks, equally divided between the two
elements.
Teachers should ensure that the chosen study enables learners to draw on
appropriate theory and to collect, analyse and present data. The use of theory and
data are assessed as part of the analysis and evaluation as can be seen in the
assessment grid in Appendix A.
