SUBJECT CONTENT
The subject content is presented under two headings: technical principles and
designing and making principles. Within each area, the content is further divided into
core knowledge and understanding and in-depth knowledge and understanding.
The specification content and assessment requirements are designed to ensure
learners develop an appropriate breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding
in design and technology.
2.1 Technical principles
Core knowledge and understanding is presented in five clear and distinct topic areas:
• design and technology and our world
• smart materials
• electronic systems and programmable components
• mechanical components and devices
• materials
Learners are required to study all of the content in these five areas, to ensure they
have a broad knowledge and understanding of design and technology and that they
are able to make effective choices in relation to which materials, components and
systems to utilise within design and make activities.
In-depth knowledge and understanding is presented in six clear and distinct topic
areas:
a. electronic systems, programmable components & mechanical devices
b. papers & boards
c. natural & manufactured timber
d. ferrous & non-ferrous metals
e. thermoforming & thermosetting polymers
f. fibres & textiles
Learners are required to study at least one of these six areas, to ensure they have an
in-depth knowledge and understanding of a specific material area and/or components
and systems to support their design and make activities.
All topics within the core knowledge and understanding, the in-depth knowledge and
understanding, and designing and making principles must be addressed. In each
case, the left hand column identifies the content topic and the amplification indicates
the areas that need to be covered. The amplification column provides more
information on the content presented in the left hand column, including the breadth
and depth of study required. Where 'e.g.' is used in the amplification column, the list
which follows is illustrative only. In all other instances, the list of items in the
amplification column must be covered. Centres are not restricted to how they will
deliver this to the learner but it is anticipated that there will be an integrated approach
between the core and the in-depth content.

GCSE DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY 6
2.2 Designing and making principles
Core knowledge and understanding that learners are required to develop and apply
is presented in ten clear topic areas:
• understanding design and technology practice
• understanding user needs
• writing a design brief and specifications
• investigating challenges
• developing ideas
• investigating the work of others
• using design strategies
• communicating ideas
• developing a prototype
• making decisions
Learners are required to cover all of the content in these ten areas, to ensure they
are able to apply a broad knowledge and understanding of design and technology
principles within design and make activities.
In-depth knowledge and understanding is presented in five clear topic areas:
• selecting and working with materials and components
• marking out
• using tools and equipment
• using specialist techniques
• using surface treatments and finishes
Learners are required to cover all of the content in these five areas, in relation to at
least one of the topic areas (a to f) identified in the in-depth knowledge and
understanding section of technical principles.
The content structure of this GCSE design and technology specification is illustrated
