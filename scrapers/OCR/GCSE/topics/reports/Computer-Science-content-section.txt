SUBJECT CONTENT
This specification promotes the integrated study of computer science. It will enable
learners to develop a broad range of skills in the areas of programming, system
development, computer architecture, data, communication and applications.
The knowledge, understanding and skills are set out in the two columns in the pages
that follow. The topic to be studied is in the first column, with the amplification in the
second column. There is no hierarchy implied by the order in which content and
amplification are presented, nor should the length of the various sections be taken to
imply any view of their relative importance.
The subject content for GCSE Computer Science will be assessed across two
components. Whist there is a degree of overlap between the content in Component 1
and Component 2, the context in which this content is assessed differs. In
Component 1, content is assessed in a theoretical way, whereas in Component 2 it is
assessed through its use within programs.

2.2 Component 2
Structure of assessment
This unit is assessed entirely by an on-screen examination. Candidates will require
access to Python 3 and a word processor. The version of Python 3 required will be
specified on the scenario issued to candidates and on the examination paper.
Before the on-screen examination
Candidates will be provided with a scenario containing a list of requirements which will
be issued to centres on 01 September in the year prior to the award. This scenario will
provide information about all tasks to be undertaken by candidates, both individually
and in groups, in preparation for the on-screen examination.
During the on-screen examination
Candidates will be issued with a question paper, a prototype Python 3 file and any
supporting files. The question paper will contain some additional requirements. These
additional requirements will need to be completed individually by each candidate and
will require them to use, evaluate and make changes to the Python 3 program provided
in the examination.
Additional examination questions will be answered in a word-processed document.
See section 3.2 below for rules regarding the administration of preparatory work and the
on-screen examination.
