================================================================
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
================================================================

1. PROVEN SCRAPING METHODS
   - Topics: PDF parsing with subject-specific patterns
   - Papers: Selenium (navigate -> expand -> scroll -> scrape)
   - Manual upload: Fast for niche/specialized subjects

2. MULTILINGUAL UNICODE SUPPORT
   - Arabic script works perfectly (المحور الأول)
   - Traditional Chinese works perfectly (當代華人社會變遷)
   - Database handles all Unicode flawlessly

3. DEEP HIERARCHIES
   - Business: 5 levels (best example for app design)
   - Chemistry: 4 levels with sub-topics
   - Most others: 3-4 levels

4. CLEAN ARCHITECTURE
   - Universal scraper for similar subjects
   - Subject-specific scrapers for unique structures
   - Manual upload templates for edge cases

================================================================
LESSONS LEARNED (IMPORTANT!)
================================================================

1. URL GUESSING DOESN'T WORK
   - Gives false positives (200 on redirect pages)
   - Claimed 72 papers for Arabic (actually 21)
   - Claimed 48 papers for Art (actually 8)
   - ALWAYS use Selenium to scrape actual page links

2. PDF STRUCTURES VARY BY SUBJECT TYPE
   - Sciences: Topic X with sub-topics (Chemistry, Physics)
   - Business: Multi-column tables with detailed hierarchy
   - Languages: Theme-based with cultural content
   - Arts: Project/discipline-based

3. MANUAL UPLOAD IS OFTEN FASTER
   - Arabic: 10 mins vs hours of scraping
   - Art and Design: Clear structure in PDF
   - Chinese: Similar to Arabic
   - Good for niche subjects with <100 topics

================================================================
REMAINING SUBJECTS (30)
================================================================

FROM BATCH RUN (need verification):
- Biology B, Design Tech, Economics A/B, English subjects, French,
  Geography, German, Greek, Gujarati, History of Art, Italian,
  Japanese, Mathematics, Persian, PE, Politics, Portuguese,
  Psychology, Religious Studies, Russian, Spanish, Statistics,
  Turkish, Urdu

KNOWN FAILURES (need manual upload):
- Drama and Theatre (9DR0)
- Music (9MU0) 
- Music Technology (9MT0)

NOTES:
- Many subjects from batch run may only have 3 topics (Papers)
- Need to verify what actually uploaded
- Apply Business scraper pattern to similar subjects
- Manual upload for specialized subjects

================================================================
RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
================================================================

1. QUERY DATABASE
   - See actual topic counts for batch run subjects
   - Identify which need re-scraping

2. APPLY BUSINESS SCRAPER TO SIMILAR SUBJECTS
   - Economics A, Economics B
   - Geography, Psychology
   - English subjects
   - (Any with similar table structure)

3. MANUAL UPLOAD REMAINING LANGUAGES
   - French, German, Spanish (similar to Arabic/Chinese)
   - Greek, Gujarati, Italian, Japanese, Persian, Portuguese,
     Russian, Turkish, Urdu

4. FIX DRAMA, MUSIC x2
   - Check PDFs for structure
   - Manual upload most likely

5. DON'T OVERTHINK IT
   - Some subjects might only need Papers
   - Not every subject needs 600+ topics
   - Focus on high-priority subjects for FLASH users

================================================================
WORKING FILES (KEEP)
================================================================

TOPICS:
- scrape-edexcel-universal.py (Chemistry, Physics, etc.)

================================================================
FILES TO DELETE (FAKE/BROKEN)
================================================================

================================================================
