From Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class Qualifications 
“The reform of the qualifications system in England is a profoundly important 
change to the education system. Teachers need to know that the new qualifications 
will assist them in helping their learners make progress in their lives. 
When these changes were first proposed we were approached by Pearson to join an 
‘Expert Panel’ that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. 
We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or 
because of our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the 
world as diverse as Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries 
across Europe. 
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification 
development process that has included: 
• Extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-
performing jurisdictions in the world 
• Benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that 
they are at the right level of demand 
• Establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-
specific expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications 
• Subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual 
accreditation criteria in advance of submission.  
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future 
oriented. The design has been guided by what is called an ‘Efficacy Framework’, 
meaning learner outcomes have been at the heart of this development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a 
learner’s success in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident 
that we have supported the development of qualifications that are outstanding for 
their coherence, thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as 
representing world-class best practice.

● provide a basis for school and college accountability measures at age 18 
● provide a benchmark of academic ability for employers. 
Qualification aims and objectives 
The aims and objectives of the Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Business 
are to enable students to:

● develop a critical understanding of organisations and their ability to meet 
society’s needs and wants 
● understand that business behaviour can be studied from a range of perspectives 
● generate enterprising and creative approaches to business opportunities, 
problems and issues 
● be aware of the ethical dilemmas and responsibilities faced by organisations and 
individuals 
● acquire a range of relevant business and generic skills, including decision 
making, problem solving, the challenging of assumptions and critical analysis 
● apply numerical skills in a range of business contexts. 
 
 
 
The context for the development of this qualification 
All our qualifications are designed to meet our World Class Qualification Principles[1] 
and our ambition to put the student at the heart of everything we do. 
We have developed and designed this qualification by: 
● reviewing other curricula and qualifications to ensure that it is comparable with 
those taken in high-performing jurisdictions overseas 
● consulting with key stakeholders on content and assessment, including learned 
bodies, subject associations, higher-education academics, teachers and 
employers to ensure this qualification is suitable for a UK context 
● reviewing the legacy qualification and building on its positive attributes. 
This qualification has also been developed to meet criteria stipulated by Ofqual in 
their documents GCE Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements and GCE 
Subject Level Conditions and Requirements for Business, published in April 2014. 
 
 
[1] Pearson’s World Class Qualification principles ensure that our qualifications are: 
● demanding, through internationally benchmarked standards, encouraging deep 
learning and measuring higher-order skills 
● rigorous, through setting and maintaining standards over time, developing 
reliable and valid assessment tasks and processes, and generating confidence in 
end users of the knowledge, skills and competencies of certified students 
● inclusive, through conceptualising learning as continuous, recognising that 
students develop at different rates and have different learning needs, and 
focusing on progression 
● empowering, through promoting the development of transferable skills, see 
Appendix 1.

Theme 3: Business decisions and strategy 
Overview 
In this theme, students develop their understanding of the 
concepts introduced in Theme 2 and explore influences on 
business strategy and decision-making.  
Students will need to build upon the knowledge, skills and 
understanding developed in Theme 2 in Theme 3, making 
connections across these two themes in Paper 2, and across 
Themes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in Paper 3. Teaching approaches to 
content must reflect this. 
Students will need to apply their knowledge and 
understanding to both familiar and unfamiliar contexts in 
the assessments and demonstrate an awareness of current 
business issues. 
Content 
This theme moves from functions to strategy, enabling 
students to develop their understanding of the core 
concepts and to take a strategic view of business 
opportunities and issues. Students analyse corporate 
objectives and strategy against financial and non-financial 
performance measures and how businesses grow, and 
develop an understanding of the impact of external 
influences. 
The theme covers the causes and effects of change and 
how businesses mitigate risk and uncertainty. 
Students must investigate different types and sizes of 
organisation in various business sectors and 
environments, and in local, national and global 
contexts. 
To develop their knowledge, skills and understanding 
in business, students need to have acquired 
competence in quantitative skills that are relevant to 
and applied in the context of this theme  
(see Appendix 3: Quantitative skills). 
For this theme, students will need to be aware of the 
accounting ratios outlined in Appendix 4: Accounting ratios.

Entry and assessment information 
Student entry 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for 
this qualification can be found in our UK Information 
Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations 
officers and is available on our website at: 
www.edexcel.com/iwantto/Pages/uk-information-
manual.aspx 
Forbidden combinations and discount code 
Centres should be aware that students who enter for more 
than one GCE qualification with the same discount code will 
have only one of the grades they achieve counted for the 
purpose of the School and College Performance Tables - 
normally the better grade (please see Appendix 5: Codes).  
Students should be advised that, if they take two 
qualifications with the same discount code, colleges, 
universities and employers are very likely to take the view 
that they have achieved only one of the two GCEs. The 
same view may be taken if students take two GCE 
qualifications that have different discount codes but have 
significant overlap of content, for example Advanced or 
Advanced Subsidiary GCEs in Economics. Students or their 
advisers who have any doubts about their subject 
combinations should check with the institution to which 
they wish to progress before embarking on their 
programmes.

Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and 
special consideration 
Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. 
They allow students with special educational needs, 
disabilities or temporary injuries to:  
● access the assessment 
● show what they know and can do without changing the 
demands of the assessment.  
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the 
particular needs of an individual disabled student without 
affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding 
bodies comply with the duty under the Equality Act 2010 to 
make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the 
start of the course. Students will then know what is 
available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for 
assessment.  
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to 
make reasonable adjustments where a person with a 
disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in 
undertaking an assessment. The awarding organisation is 
required to take reasonable steps to overcome that 
disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular person may be 
unique to that individual and therefore might not be in the 
list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will 
depend on a number of factors, which will include: 
● the needs of the student with the disability 
● the effectiveness of the adjustment 
● the cost of the adjustment; and 
● the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with 
the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves 
unreasonable costs to the awarding organisation, 
timeframes or affects the security or integrity of the 
assessment. This is because the adjustment is not 
‘reasonable’.

Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a 
student's mark or grade to reflect temporary injury, illness 
or other indisposition at the time of the 
examination/assessment, which has had, or is reasonably 
likely to have had, a material effect on a candidate’s ability 
to take an assessment or demonstrate his or her level of 
attainment in an assessment.

Appendix 1: Transferable skills 
 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently 
flagged the need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable 
them to respond with confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the 
world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines 
skills, or competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that 
can be learned and that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform 
an activity or task and can be built upon and extended through learning.’1 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected 
and evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this 
process, we identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework as the 
most evidence-based and robust skills framework. We adapted the framework 
slightly to include the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) ICT 
Literacy and Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) Skills. 
The adapted National Research Council’s framework of skills involves:2 
Cognitive skills 
● Non-routine problem solving – expert thinking, metacognition, creativity. 
● Systems thinking – decision making and reasoning. 
● Critical thinking – definitions of critical thinking are broad and usually involve 
general cognitive skills such as analysing, synthesising and reasoning skills. 
● ICT literacy – access, manage, integrate, evaluate, construct and 
communicate3. 
Interpersonal skills 
● Communication – active listening, oral communication, written 
communication, assertive communication and non-verbal communication. 
● Relationship-building skills – teamwork, trust, intercultural sensitivity, 
service orientation, self-presentation, social influence, conflict resolution and 
negotiation. 
● Collaborative problem solving – establishing and maintaining shared 
understanding, taking appropriate action, establishing and maintaining team 
organisation.

Intrapersonal skills 
● Adaptability – ability and willingness to cope with the uncertain, handling work 
stress, adapting to different personalities, communication styles and cultures, 
and physical adaptability to various indoor and outdoor work environments. 
● Self-management and self-development – ability to work remotely in virtual 
teams, work autonomously, be self-motivating and self-monitoring, willing and 
able to acquire new information and skills related to work. 
Transferable skills enable young people to face the demands of further and higher 
education, as well as the demands of the workplace, and are important in the 
teaching and learning of this qualification. We will provide teaching and learning 
materials, developed with stakeholders, to support our qualifications.

Appendix 2: Level 3 Extended Project 
qualification  
 
What is the Extended Project? 
The Extended Project is a standalone qualification that can be taken alongside 
GCEs. It supports the development of independent learning skills and helps to 
prepare students for their next step – whether that be university study or 
employment. The qualification: 
● is recognised by universities for the skills it develops 
● is worth half of an Advanced GCE qualification at grades A*–E  
● carries UCAS points for university entry. 
The Extended Project encourages students to develop skills in the following areas: 
research, critical thinking, extended writing and project management. Students 
identify and agree a topic area of their choice (which may or may not be related to 
a GCE subject they are already studying), guided by their teacher. 
Students can choose from one of four approaches to produce: 
● a dissertation (for example, an investigation based on predominately secondary 
research) 
● an investigation/field study (for example, a practical experiment) 
● a performance (for example, in music, drama or sport) 
● an artefact (for example, a creating a sculpture in response to a client 
brief or solving an engineering problem). 
The qualification is coursework based and students are assessed on the skills of 
managing, planning and evaluating their project. Students will research their topic, 
develop skills to review and evaluate the information, and then present the final 
outcome of their project. 
Students: what they need to do 
The Extended Project qualification requires students to: 
● select a topic of interest for an in-depth study and negotiate the scope of the 
project with their teacher 
● identify and draft an objective for their project (for example, in the form of a 
question, hypothesis, challenge, outline of proposed performance, issue to be 
investigated or commission for a client) and provide a rationale for their choice 
● produce a plan for how they will deliver their intended objective 
● conduct research as required by the project brief, using appropriate techniques 
● carry out the project using tools and techniques safely 
● share the outcome of the project using appropriate communication methods, 
including a presentation.

Teachers: key information 
● The Extended Project has 120 guided learning hours (GLH) consisting of: 
o a 40-GLH taught element that includes teaching the technical skills (for 
example, research skills) 
o an 80–GLH guided element that includes mentoring students through the 
project work. 
● Group work is acceptable, however it is important that each student provides 
evidence of their own contribution and produces their own report. 
● 100% externally moderated. 
● Four Assessment Objectives: manage, use resources, develop and realise, 
review. 
● Can be run over 1, 1½ or 2 years. 
● Can be submitted in January or June. 
How to link the Extended Project with Business 
The Extended Project creates the opportunity to develop transferable skills for 
progression to higher education and to the workplace, through the exploration of 
either an area of personal interest or a topic of interest within the business 
qualification content. Through the study of this business qualification, students will 
develop knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues; apply these 
concepts and issues to real world contexts; then analyse and evaluate the concepts 
and issues.  
Skills developed 
Through the Extended Project students will develop skills in: 
● conducting, organising and using research 
● independent reading in the subject area 
● planning, project management and time management 
● defining a hypothesis to be tested in investigations or developing a design brief 
● collecting, handling and interpreting data and evidence 
● evaluating arguments and processes, including arguments in favour of 
alternative interpretations of data and evaluation of experimental methodology 
● critical thinking. 
In the context of the Extended Project, critical thinking refers to the ability to 
identify and develop arguments for a point of view or hypothesis and to consider 
and respond to alternative arguments. This supports the development of evaluative 
skills, through evaluating business arguments, and using qualitative and 
quantitative evidence to support informed judgements and propose evidence-based 
solutions to business issues.  
The Extended Project is an ideal vehicle to develop the skills identified in  
Appendix 1.

Types of Extended Project 
Students may choose a university-style dissertation on any topic which can be 
researched and argued, for example a controversial business issue such as child 
labour, executive pay or advertising to children. 
A dissertation might involve an investigation such as: 
● the impact of digital downloads on the music industry 
● an investigation into the ease of doing business in a chosen country. 
The dissertation uses secondary research sources to provide a reasoned defence or 
a point of view, with consideration of counter-arguments. 
An alternative might be an investigative project or field study involving the 
collection of data from primary research, for example: 
● a study of the impact of unemployment on the local community 
● a statistical survey of changing social attitudes towards online purchasing. 
A field study might consider an issue that lends itself to primary research, for 
example an investigation into the motivation techniques used in a chosen business. 
Using the Extended Project to support breadth and depth 
There is no specified material that students are expected to study and, in the 
Extended Project, students are assessed on the quality of the work they produce 
and the skills they develop and demonstrate through completing this work. 
Students can use the Extended Project to demonstrate extension in one or more 
dimensions: 
● deepening understanding – where a student explores a topic in greater depth 
than in the specification content. This could be an in-depth exploration of one 
aspect of the broad pre-release context 
● broadening skills – where a student learns a new skill. This might be learning 
how to design a website or learning a new statistical technique which can be 
used in the analysis of either primary or secondary data collected by the student 
● widening perspectives – where the student’s project spans different subjects. 
A student studying business with geography may wish to research the impact of 
tourism on a particular region or locality. A student studying business with 
mathematics may wish to use statistical techniques to analyse market data and 
research one aspect of a market in more detail. A student studying business 
with psychology may wish to conduct an experiment into influences on 
consumer purchasing. 
A wide range of information to support the delivery and assessment of the 
Extended Project, including the specification, teacher guidance for all aspects, an 
editable scheme of work and exemplars for all four approaches, can be found on 
our website at www.edexcel.com/project
