1 Introduction 
Why choose Pearson Edexcel A Level Statistics? 
Using and understanding data is becoming increasingly important in many areas of study and 
employment. Understanding of statistics is a crucial skill, and this specification aims to give 
students the tools needed to help them prepare for higher education and the workplace.  
A Level Statistics might appeal to the student seeking to pursue the study of a numerate 
post-16 subject but not wishing to study pure mathematics. It sits well with subjects such as 
A level Biology, Psychology, Geography, Business Studies and Economics. The emphasis is 
on using and applying statistics; appropriate interpretation of contexts and the outcomes of 
statistical procedures will be required. 
We’ve listened to feedback from the mathematics subject community. We’ve used this 
opportunity of curriculum change to redesign qualifications so that they reflect the demands 
of a wide variety of end users – a qualification that enables your students to apply 
themselves and give them the logical, problem-solving and numerical skills to succeed in 
their chosen pathway.  
We will provide: 
Straightforward assessment structure. Our qualification has a straightforward structure, 
with three papers of equal size and weighting: one paper assessing data and probability, 
another on statistical inference, and a third paper assessing the specification as a whole. The 
statistical enquiry cycle is integrated with the statistical methods, supporting an integrated 
approach to statistics teaching, learning and exam preparation. 
Accessible question papers that support a range of abilities. Our exam papers follow 
the same clear design that you’ve told us makes them so accessible, with careful ramping 
also ensuring a range of challenge to support students of all abilities in achieving their 
potential. 
Real-world data and context for transferable skills. Our qualifications will help students 
to develop the skills of statistical enquiry, and practise the underpinning statistical 
calculations and interpretation using real-world data and authentic contexts. Our approach 
supports skills development for progression to a range of other subjects and develops an 
awareness of statistics beyond the classroom. 
Trusted, expert support for the specifications. You will receive the support you know 
and trust from Pearson Edexcel. With a large number of resources available throughout the 
year on our Qualifications website and the Maths Emporium, we will ensure that you have 
the support you need to teach this qualification.

Specification – Issue 2 – January 2024 – © Pearson Education Limited 2024 
10 
6  Normal distribution 
Subject content Additional information 
6.1 Know the specific properties of the 
normal distribution, and know that 
data from such an underlying 
population would approximate to 
having these properties, with 
different samples showing variation. 
Students should be aware that the normal

7  Correlation and linear regression 
Subject content Additional information 
7.1 Calculate (only using appropriate 
technology ‒ calculator) and 
interpret association using 
Spearman’s rank correlation 
coefficient or Pearson’s product 
moment correlation coefficient. 
 
When evaluating Spearman’s coefficient, 
candidates will be expected to: 
● rank both variables consistently 
● rank tied values appropriately 
● use a calculator to obtain the value of 
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient 
Students will be expected to find Pearson’s 
product moment correlation coefficients directly 
from the calculator. 
Interpretation of correlation coefficients should 
always be in the context of the question. 
7.2 Use tables to test for significance of 
a correlation coefficient. 
A test on a Pearson’s correlation coefficient 
requires the assumption that the population has a 
bivariate normal distribution. 
7.3 Know the appropriate conditions for 
the use of each of these methods of 
calculating correlation and determine 
an appropriate approach to assessing 
correlation in context. 
Pearson’s product moment correlation 
coefficient measures the strength of the linear 
relationship between 2 variables.  
For Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, no 
assumptions are necessary regarding the 
distribution used. 
7.4 Calculate (only using appropriate 
technology ‒ calculator) and 
interpret the coefficients for a least 
squares regression line in context; 
interpolation and extrapolation, and 
use of residuals to evaluate the 
model and identify outliers. 
Students will be expected to find the coefficients 
for a least squares regression line directly from 
the calculator. 
Students will be expected to know that 
residual iiy a bx= −−  for a least squares 
regression line of the form y a bx= +  
Students will be expected to make a numeric 
evaluation of a residual when asked for the value 
of a specific residual(s) but may be asked to 
make general comments regarding residuals 
visually from a scatter graph with a line of best 
fit drawn on it.

8  Introduction to hypothesis testing 
Subject content Additional information 
8.1 Use and demonstrate understanding 
of the terms parameter, statistic, 
unbiased and standard error. 
Students will be expected to know that: 
● a parameter is a numerical property of a 
population 
● a statistic is a numerical property of a sample 
and is a function only of the values in the 
sample and contains no unknown parameters. 
Students should be familiar with the notationsµ 
and σ 2 for a population mean and variance 
respectively. 
8.2 Know and use the language of 
statistical hypothesis testing: null 
hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, 
significance level, test statistic,  
1- tail test, 2-tail test, critical value, 
critical region, and acceptance 
region and p-value. 
Students will be expected to use the convention 
of a 5% significance level unless directed 
otherwise. 
8.3 Know that a sample is being used to 
make an inference about the 
population and appreciate the need 
for a random sample and of the 
necessary conditions. 
Students should be aware that a conclusion to a 
hypothesis test should not be stated as definite. 
8.4 Choose the appropriate hypothesis 
test to carry out in particular 
circumstances. 
 
8.5 Conduct a statistical hypothesis test 
for the proportion in the binomial 
distribution and interpret the results 
in context using exact probabilities 
or, where appropriate, a normal 
approximation. 
In a hypothesis test on a population proportion, 
candidates may use either π or p as the 
parameter in their hypotheses. 
 
8.6 Conduct a statistical hypothesis test 
for the mean of a normal distribution 
with known or assumed variance, 
from a large sample, and interpret 
the results in context. 
 
8.7 Know the importance of appropriate 
sampling when using hypothesis 
tests and be able to critique the 
conclusions drawn from rejecting or 
failing to reject a null hypothesis by 
considering the test performed.

9  Contingency tables 
Subject content Additional information 
9.1 Construct contingency tables from 
real data, combining data where 
appropriate, and interpret results in 
context. 
 
9.2 Use a χ2 test with the appropriate 
number of degrees of freedom to test 
for independence in a contingency 
table and interpret the results of such 
a test. 
Students will be expected to know how to find 
the number of degrees of freedom and that 
questions set will not require the use of Yates’ 
correction. 
 
9.3 Know that expected frequencies 
must be greater than, or equal to, 5 
for a χ2 test to be carried out and 
understand the requirement for 
combining classes if that is not the 
case. 
Students must combine classes when expected 
frequencies are smaller than 5, and 'pooling' is 
sensible. 
 
10 One and two sample non-parametric tests 
Subject content Additional information 
10.1 Use sign or Wilcoxon signed-rank 
tests to investigate population 
median in single sample tests and 
also to investigate for differences 
using a paired model. 
Students will be expected to use the sign test or 
the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to: 
● test the value of a single population median 
based on a single sample 
● test for a difference between two population 
medians based on a sample of 'paired' data. 
Students will be expected to learn and recall 
necessary conditions for the validity of these 
tests, and may be required to use these to select 
the test that is most appropriate in a given 
context. 
Sign test – no assumptions necessary regarding 
the distribution for test to be valid. 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test – assumption that the 
distribution is symmetrical, or that the 
distribution of differences is symmetrical in the 
case of a paired test, for test to be valid. 
10.2 Use the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to 
investigate for difference between 
independent samples. 
Students will be expected to test for a difference 
between two population medians, based on two 
independent samples, using the Wilcoxon  
rank-sum test (this is also known as the  
Mann-Whitney test).

Students should know that  
( ) ( ) ( )E EEaX bY a X b Y±= ±  
12.3 Evaluate probabilities for linear 
combinations of two or more 
independent normal distributions and 
apply this knowledge to practical 
situations.

Subject content Additional information 
14.1 Use and demonstrate understanding 
of terms parameter, statistic, 
unbiased and standard error. 
 
Students will be expected to know that: 
● a parameter is a numerical property of a 
population 
● a statistic is a numerical property of a sample 
and is a function of only the values in the 
sample and contains no unknown parameters. 
14.2 Know the use of the central limit 
theorem in the distribution of X   
where the initial distribution, X, is 
not normally distributed and the 
sample is large. 
Students are expected to know that: 
● the central limit theorem may be used when 
the sample size (of random samples) is 
sufficiently large (n 30) 
● it is only necessary to use the central limit 
theorem when the underlying population is 
not normally distributed. 
15 Hypothesis testing, significance testing, confidence intervals  
and power 
Subject content Additional information 
15.1 Use confidence intervals for the 
mean using z or t as appropriate, 
interpreting results in practical 
contexts. 
Students are expected to use the t-distribution 
when the sample size is small (n < 30) and the 
population standard deviation,σ , is unknown. 
Students should be familiar with the notation 
x and s2 as statistics evaluated from a sample for 
respective estimates of µ and 2σ . 
Students should know that the (n −1) divisor is 
used when evaluating s2. 
Students will be expected to learn the formulae 
for constructing a confidence interval for a 
population mean: 
( ) ( )or standard errorx zt±×

will affect the width of a confidence 
interval. 
Students will be expected to be able to find the 
sample size required in order to obtain a 
confidence interval with a specified width.

and power (continued)  
Subject content Additional information 
15.5 Interpret Type I and Type II errors, 
in hypothesis testing and know their 
practical meaning. 
Students will be expected to know that: 
● a Type I error is when the null hypothesis is 
true but is rejected 
● a Type II error is when the null hypothesis is 
false but is accepted 
and that these should be interpreted in the given 
context. 
Students should understand the link between the 
significance level of a test and the probabilities 
of Type I and Type II errors for the test. Also, 
the impact on these errors of selecting a different 
significance level. 
15.6 Calculate the risk of a Type II error. Students are expected to know that the power of 
a test is given by

Subject content Additional information 
16.3 difference of two means for two 
independent normal distributions 
with unknown but equal variances 
Students should be aware that a test for a 
difference of two means for two independent 
normal distributions with unknown variances is 
valid only if equal variances can be assumed.  
Candidates will be expected to use a pooled 
estimate for an unknown common population 
variance. 
Candidates will not be expected to test for 
equality of variances. 
t-test – assumptions required are that both 
distributions are normal and have equal 
variances for test to be valid.

necessary conditions for the validity of these 
tests, and may be required to use these to select 
the test that is most appropriate in a given 
context. 
Sign test – no assumption necessary regarding 
the distribution for test to be valid. 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test – assumption that the 
distribution of differences is symmetrical for test 
to be valid. 
Paired t-test – assumption required is that the 
distribution of differences is normal for test to 
be valid.

Subject content Additional information 
18.1 Determine when a Poisson model is 
appropriate (in real world situations 
including modelling assumptions). 
Students will be expected to know the conditions 
necessary for a Poisson model to be appropriate 
and to explain or discuss whether these 
conditions are likely to be present in a given 
context. 
18.2 Determine when an exponential 
distribution is appropriate (and its 
relationship to the Poisson 
distribution as a model of the times 
between randomly occurring Poisson 
events). 
Students will be expected to know and use the 
relationship between corresponding Poisson and 
exponential distributions, in a given context, for 
Poisson events occurring randomly in time or in 
space. 
18.3 Evaluate probabilities for Poisson 
and exponential distributions and 
know the corresponding mean and 
variance. 
Students will not be expected to derive the 
formulae for the mean and variance. 
19 Goodness of fit 
Subject content Additional information 
19.1 Conduct a statistical goodness of fit 
test for binomial, Poisson, normal 
and exponential distributions or for a 
specified discrete distribution using 
( )
2
OE
E
−
∑  as an approximate  
χ2 statistic. 
Students will be expected to know how to find 
the number of degrees of freedom and that 
questions set will not require the use of Yates’ 
correction. 
Students must follow the rule to combine classes 
when expected frequencies are smaller than 5, 
and 'pooling' is sensible.

20 Analysis of variance 
Subject content Additional information 
20.1 Conduct one-way analysis of 
variance, using a completely 
randomised design with appreciation 
of the underlying model with 
additive effects and experimental 
errors distributed as N(0,σ 2). 
Students will only be required to use one-factor 
ANOVA or two-factor ANOVA (and will not be 
required to use a Latin square). 
(applies to all of section 20) 
 
 
 
 
ANOVA - assumptions that the distributions 
from which the samples are taken are normal 
and have equal variances for the test to be valid.  
20.2 Conduct two-way analysis of 
variance without replication, using a 
randomised block design with 
blocking. 
20.3 Identify assumptions and 
interpretations in context. 
21 Effect size 
Subject content Additional information 
21.1 Know the notion of effect size as a 
complementary methodology to 
standard significance testing, and 
apply in authentic contexts. 
Students should be aware that interpretation of 
effect size depends on the context involved and 
that effect size simply quantifies the size of the 
difference between two means (rather than its 
statistical significance). 
Students should also be aware that a p-value, in 
the context of testing for statistical significance, 
depends on both the effect size and the sample 
size. 
21.2 Know and use Cohen’s d in simple 
situations. 
Students should be aware of the standard 
guideline boundaries for interpreting the value 
of Cohen’s d. 
0.2 d < 0.5 small effect size 
0.5 d < 0.8 medium effect size 
0.8 d large effect size

Statistical Enquiry Cycle (SEC) 
The Statistical Enquiry Cycle (SEC) underpins the study of Statistics. Students need to be able 
to apply the knowledge and techniques outlined in this section within the framework of the 
SEC. The cycle covers five stages: 
● initial planning 
● data collection 
● data processing and presentation 
● interpretation of results 
● evaluation and review. 
The detail of the SEC is provided below. During their learning students should develop their 
understanding of the SEC through a variety of authentic contexts. Practical experience of the 
cycle is integral to their understanding of the principles of the SEC. 
Students should anticipate that they may occasionally be presented, within the context of 
applying elements of the SEC cycle, unfamiliar acronyms or scenarios in real-life data. 
 
A Initial planning 
Students must understand the importance of initial planning when designing a line of enquiry 
or investigation including: 
1 identifying factors that may be related to the problem under investigation 
2 defining a question or hypothesis (or hypotheses) to investigate 
3 deciding what data to collect, and how to collect and record it, giving reasons 
4 engaging in exploratory data analysis in order to investigate the situation 
5 developing a strategy for how to process and represent the data giving reasons 
6 justifying the proposed plan with regards to ensuring a lack of bias. 
 
B Data collection 
Students must recognise the constraints involved in sourcing data including: 
1 when designing unbiased collection methods for primary sample data 
2 when researching sources of secondary data, including from reference publications, the 
internet and the media 
3 the importance of declaring the data collection methodology, including appreciating the 
importance of acknowledging sources 
4 appreciating the inherent bias that may be incorporated through the use of leading 
questions either by accident or through agenda driven design. 
 
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Statistics  
Specification – Issue 2 – January 2024 – © Pearson Education Limited 2024

C Data processing and presentation 
Students must understand a range of techniques in order to process, represent and discuss data 
including: 
1 organising and processing data, including an understanding of how technology can be used 
2 make inferences about the population using appropriately chosen diagrams and summary 
measures to represent data including an understanding of outputs generated by appropriate 
technology 
3 appreciating how to avoid misrepresentation of data. 
 
D Interpretation of results 
Students must appreciate the need to consider the context of the problem when interpreting 
results: 
1 analysing/interpreting diagrams and calculations/measures 
2 drawing together conclusions that relate to the questions and hypotheses addressed 
3 using appropriate tests to determine the statistical significance of the findings 
4 discussing the reliability of findings 
5 Students must show an understanding of the importance of the clear and concise 
communication of findings and key ideas, and awareness of target audience. 
 
E Evaluation and review 
Students must be able to understand the importance of evaluating statistical work including: 
1 identifying weaknesses in approaches used to collect or display data 
2 recognising the limitations of findings by considering sample size and sampling technique 
3 suggesting improvements to statistical processes or presentation 
4 refining processes to elicit further clarification of the initial hypothesis.

4 Administration and general information 
Entries 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our UK Information Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers and is 
available on our website: qualifications.pearson.com 
Discount code and performance tables 
Centres should be aware that students who enter for more than one GCE qualification with 
the same discount code will have only one of the grades they achieve counted for the 
purpose of the school and college performance tables. This will be the grade for the larger 
qualification (i.e. the A Level grade rather than the AS grade). If the qualifications are the 
same size, then the better grade will be counted (please see Appendix 8: Codes). 
Students should be advised that if they take two GCE qualifications with the same discount 
code, colleges, universities and employers they wish to progress to are likely to take the 
view that this achievement is equivalent to only one GCE. The same view may be taken if 
students take two GCE qualifications that have different discount codes but have significant 
overlap of content. Students or their advisers who have any doubts about their subject 
combinations should check with the institution they wish to progress to before embarking on 
their programmes.  
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, 
special consideration and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
● students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
● all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will be available in English. All student work must be in 
English.  
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Statistics  
Specification – Issue 2 – January 2024 – © Pearson Education Limited 2024 
26 
Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to:  
● access the assessment 
● show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment.  
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability, without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under the 
Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment.  
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable adjustments 
where a person with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in undertaking an 
assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps to overcome 
that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular person may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
including: 
● the needs of the student with the disability 
● the effectiveness of the adjustment 
● the cost of the adjustment; and 
● the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation, or affects timeframes or the security or integrity of the assessment. This is 
because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a student's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the examination/ 
assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material effect on a 
candidate’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate their level of attainment in  
an assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements 
and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
consideration, please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk.

Malpractice 
Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in examinations must be reported to Pearson using a JCQ Form M1 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form should be emailed to 
candidatemalpractice@pearson.com. Please provide as much information and supporting 
documentation as possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies 
with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice. 
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the 
integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on a  
JCQ Form M2(a) (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice).  
The form, supporting documentation and as much information as possible should be emailed 
to pqsmalpractice@pearson.com. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions 
lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
General and Vocational Qualifications Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and 
Assessments Policies and Procedures, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice. 
Awarding and reporting 
This qualification will be graded, awarded and certificated to comply with the requirements of 
Ofqual's General Conditions of Recognition. 
This A Level qualification will be graded and certificated on a six-grade scale from A* to E 
using the total subject mark. Individual papers are not graded. 
Students whose level of achievement is below the minimum judged by Pearson to be of 
sufficient standard to be recorded on a certificate will receive an unclassified U result. 
The first certification opportunity for this qualification will be 2019. 
Student recruitment and progression 
Pearson follows the JCQ policy concerning recruitment to our qualifications in that: 
● they must be available to anyone who is capable of reaching the required standard 
● they must be free from barriers that restrict access and progression 
● equal opportunities exist for all students.

Appendix 3: Numerical skills 
The numerical skills, developed in GCSE (9-1) mathematics, required for A Level Statistics. 
Integers, fractions, decimals and percentages 
● Work interchangeably with terminating decimals and their corresponding fractions (such 
as 3.5 and 7
2
 or 0.375 and 3
8
 ), and recognise that some fractions can be written as 
recurring decimals. 
● Identify and work with fractions in ratio problems. 
● Interpret fractions and percentages as operators. 
Structure and calculation 
● Order positive integers, decimals and fractions. 
● Understand and use the symbols =, ≠, <, >,  and  
● Apply the four operations to integers, decimals and simple fractions (proper and 
improper), and mixed numbers. 
● Understand and use place value (e.g. when working with very large or very small 
numbers, and when calculating with decimals). 
● Recognise, use and manipulate numbers in standard form. 
● Recognise and use relationships between operations, including inverse operations (e.g. 
cancellation to simplify calculations and expressions; use conventional notation for priority 
of operations, including brackets, powers, roots and reciprocals). 
● Substitute numerical values into formulae and expressions, including scientific formulae. 
● Understand and use standard mathematical formulae, and rearrange formulae to change 
the subject. 
● Solve algebraic equations, including simultaneous equations. 
● Work with coordinates on Cartesian grid. 
Measures and accuracy 
● Use standard units of mass, length, time, money and other measures (including standard 
compound measures) using decimal quantities where appropriate. 
● Estimate answers and check calculations using approximation and estimation, including 
answers obtained using technology. 
● Use compound units such as speed, rates of pay and unit pricing including working out a 
unit for a rate. 
● Round numbers and measures to an appropriate degree of accuracy (e.g. to a specified 
number of decimal places or significant figures), and use inequality notation to specify 
simple error intervals due to truncation or rounding. 
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Statistics  
Specification – Issue 2 – January 2024 – © Pearson Education Limited 2024 
37 
Ratio, proportion and rates of change 
● Express one quantity as a fraction of another, where the fraction is less than 1 or greater 
than 1. 
● Use ratio notation, including reduction to simplest form. 
● Divide a given quantity into two parts in a given part, part or part, and whole ratio; 
express the division of a quantity into two parts as a ratio; and apply ratio to real contexts 
and problems (such as those involving probability). 
● Relate ratios to fractions and vice versa. 
● Define percentage as ‘number of parts per hundred’; interpret percentages and 
percentage changes as a fraction or a decimal, and interpret these multiplicatively; 
express one quantity as a percentage of another; and compare two quantities using 
percentages.

Appendix 4: Use of calculators and other 
technology 
Use of calculators 
Students may use a calculator in all A Level Statistics examinations. Students are responsible 
for making sure that their calculators meet the guidelines set out in this appendix. 
The use of technology permeates the study of A Level Statistics. Calculators used must 
include the following features: 
● the ability to compute summary statistics (to include mean, standard deviation, regression 
and correlation coefficients). 
● the ability to access probabilities from standard statistical distributions (to include 
binomial, Poisson and normal). 
The use of a graphics calculator with additional statistical functions is encouraged. 
In addition, students must be told these regulations before sitting an examination: 
 
During an examination a calculator must not be able to offer any of these facilities:  
● language translators;  
● symbolic algebra manipulation;  
● symbolic differentiation or integration;  
● communication with other machines or the internet;  
During an examination a calculator must not give access to pre-stored information. This includes:  
● databanks;  
● dictionaries;  
● mathematical formulae;  
● text.  
A calculator must not be borrowed from another candidate during an examination.  
Some calculators have an ‘exam mode’. This is acceptable in examinations where the exam mode is 
activated and the exam mode results in the calculator becoming compliant with the above 
requirements.  
An invigilator may give a candidate a replacement calculator.  
 
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Statistics  
Specification – Issue 2 – January 2024 – © Pearson Education Limited 2024 
39 
Use of other technology 
Students are expected to be familiar with the following language and techniques when 
working with databases and spreadsheets. 
Spreadsheets 
Students should understand: 
● how to use a ‘filter’ 
● how to ‘sort’ data 
● how to use basic functions that count or sum data points 
● how to use basic functions that find an average or a measure of spread. 
Databases 
Students should understand 
● what a ‘field’ and a ‘record’ are. 
● how to use a ‘filter’ 
● how to ‘sort’ data 
● how to produce a ‘query’ which will… 
o …group by data values from a given field 
o …count or sum data from a given field 
o …produce a basic join between two data tables. 
Graph-plotting software 
Students are expected to be able to interpret outputs from graph-plotting software, such as: 
● Bar charts & pie charts 
● Scatter diagrams, including regression lines 
● Stem and leaf diagrams 
● Box and whisker plots 
● Cumulative frequency diagrams 
● Histograms 
● Time series, including trend lines 
Students should be familiar with those visualisation types available in Section 1.1 of the 
content, together with pie charts (assumed knowledge), and should explore such 
visualisations in published visualisations. These visualisations are the only visualisations that 
may appear in questions which contain visualisations of univariate or multivariate data, other 
than published tabulated results. Questions may require students to comment on or analyse 
such visualisations. For example, a scatter graph illustrating petal length and petal width for 
3 species of Iris, from Edgar Robinson's Iris data (readily available on the internet), is an 
example of visualisation of multivariate data.  
Additionally, students should be familiar with the nature of outputs from standard ICT 
packages or calculator displays, including common abbreviations such as 'df' for 'degrees of 
freedom'. They should be able to identify those parts of such an output that are relevant 
when answering questions
.

Appendix 5: The context for the 
development of this qualification 
All our qualifications are designed to meet our World Class Qualification Principles[1] and our 
ambition to put the student at the heart of everything we do. 
We have developed and designed this qualification by: 
● reviewing other curricula and qualifications to ensure that it is comparable with those 
taken in high-performing jurisdictions overseas 
● consulting with key stakeholders on content and assessment, including learned bodies, 
subject associations, higher-education academics, teachers and employers to ensure this 
qualification is suitable for a UK context 
● reviewing the legacy qualification and building on its positive attributes. 
This qualification has also been developed to meet criteria stipulated by Ofqual in their 
documents GCE Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements and GCE Subject Level 
Conditions and Requirements for Statistics, published in May 2016. 
 
 
[1] Pearson’s World Class Qualification Principles ensure that our qualifications are: 
● demanding, through internationally benchmarked standards, encouraging deep learning and 
measuring higher-order skills 
● rigorous, through setting and maintaining standards over time, developing reliable and valid 
assessment tasks and processes, and generating confidence in end users of the knowledge, skills 
and competencies of certified students 
● inclusive, through conceptualising learning as continuous, recognising that students develop at 
different rates and have different learning needs, and focusing on progression 
● empowering, through promoting the development of transferable skills, see Appendix 6.

From Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class Qualifications 
May 2014 
“The reform of the qualifications system in England is a profoundly important change to the 
education system. Teachers need to know that the new qualifications will assist them in 
helping their learners make progress in their lives. 
When these changes were first proposed we were approached by Pearson to join an ‘Expert 
Panel’ that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. 
We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of 
our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe. 
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification development 
process that has included: 
● extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-performing 
jurisdictions in the world 
● benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they are at 
the right level of demand 
● establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications 
● subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual 
accreditation criteria in advance of submission.  
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented. The 
design has been guided by what is called an ‘Efficacy Framework’, meaning learner outcomes 
have been at the heart of this development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s 
success in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have 
supported the development of qualifications that are outstanding for their coherence, 
thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as representing world-class best 
practice.”

Appendix 6: Transferable skills 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned and 
that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and can be 
built upon and extended through learning.’ [1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework as the most evidence-based and 
robust skills framework. We adapted the framework slightly to include the Program for 
International Student Assessment (PISA) ICT Literacy and Collaborative Problem Solving 
(CPS) Skills. 
The adapted National Research Council’s framework of skills involves: [2]  
Cognitive skills 
● Non-routine problem solving – expert thinking, metacognition, creativity. 
● Systems thinking – decision making and reasoning. 
● Critical thinking – definitions of critical thinking are broad and usually involve general 
cognitive skills such as analysing, synthesising and reasoning skills. 
● ICT literacy – access, manage, integrate, evaluate, construct and communicate. [3]  
Interpersonal skills 
● Communication – active listening, oral communication, written communication, assertive 
communication and non-verbal communication. 
● Relationship-building skills – teamwork, trust, intercultural sensitivity, service 
orientation, self-presentation, social influence, conflict resolution and negotiation. 
● Collaborative problem solving – establishing and maintaining shared understanding, 
taking appropriate action, establishing and maintaining team organisation. 
Intrapersonal skills 
● Adaptability – ability and willingness to cope with the uncertain, handling work stress, 
adapting to different personalities, communication styles and cultures, and physical 
adaptability to various indoor and outdoor work environments. 
● Self-management and self-development – ability to work remotely in virtual teams, 
work autonomously, be self-motivating and self-monitoring, willing and able to acquire 
new information and skills related to work. 
Transferable skills enable young people to face the demands of further and higher education, 
as well as the demands of the workplace, and are important in the teaching and learning of 
this qualification. We will provide teaching and learning materials, developed with 
stakeholders, to support our qualifications.

Appendix 7: Level 3 Extended Project 
qualification 
What is the Extended Project?  
The Extended Project is a standalone qualification that can be taken alongside GCEs. It 
supports the development of independent learning skills and helps to prepare students for 
their next step – whether that be higher education or employment. The qualification:  
● is recognised by higher education for the skills it develops  
● is worth half of an Advanced GCE qualification at grades A*–E  
● carries UCAS points for university entry.  
The Extended Project encourages students to develop skills in the following areas: research, 
critical thinking, extended writing and project management. Students identify and agree a 
topic area of their choice for in-depth study (which may or may not be related to a GCE 
subject they are already studying), guided by their teacher.  
Students can choose from one of four approaches to produce:  
● a dissertation (for example an investigation based on predominately secondary research)  
● an investigation/field study (for example a practical experiment)  
● a performance (for example in music, drama or sport)  
● an artefact (for example creating a sculpture in response to a client brief or solving an 
engineering problem).  
The qualification is non-examination assessment based and students are assessed on the 
skills of managing, planning and evaluating their project. Students will research their topic, 
develop skills to review and evaluate the information, and then present the final outcome of 
their project. 
The Extended Project has 120 guided learning hours (GLH) consisting of a 40-GLH taught 
element that includes teaching the technical skills (for example research skills) and an  
80-GLH guided element that includes mentoring students through the project work. The 
qualification is 100% internally assessed and externally moderated. 
How to link the Extended Project with statistics  
The Extended Project creates the opportunity to develop transferable skills for progression to 
higher education and to the workplace, through the exploration of either an area of personal 
interest or a topic of interest from within the statistics qualification content.  
Through the Extended Project, students will develop skills that support their study of 
statistics, including:  
● conducting, organising and using research  
● independent reading in the subject area  
● planning, project management and time management  
● defining a hypothesis to be tested in investigations or developing a design brief  
● collecting, handling and interpreting data and evidence  
● evaluating arguments and processes, including arguments in favour of alternative 
interpretations of data and evaluation of experimental methodology  
● critical thinking.  
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Statistics  
Specification – Issue 2 – January 2024 – © Pearson Education Limited 2024 
44 
In the context of the Extended Project, critical thinking refers to the ability to identify and 
develop arguments for a point of view or hypothesis and to consider and respond to 
alternative arguments. This supports the development of evaluative skills, through 
evaluating qualitative and quantitative evidence to support informed judgements and 
propose evidence-based solutions to statistics issues.  
Types of Extended Project related to statistics 
Students may produce a dissertation on any topic that can be researched and argued, for 
example a controversial business issue such as child labour, executive pay or advertising to 
children.  
A dissertation might involve an investigation such as:  
● the impact of digital downloads on the music industry  
● the ease of doing business in a chosen country.  
The dissertation uses secondary research sources to provide a reasoned defence or a point of 
view, with consideration of counter-arguments.  
An alternative might be an investigative project or field study involving the collection of data 
from primary research, for example:  
● a study of the impact of unemployment on the local community  
● a statistical survey of changing social attitudes towards online purchasing.  
A field study might consider an issue that lends itself to primary research, for example an 
investigation into the motivation techniques used in a chosen business.  
Using the Extended Project to support breadth and depth  
In the Extended Project, students are assessed on the quality of the work they produce and 
the skills they develop and demonstrate through completing this work. Students should 
demonstrate that they have extended themselves in some significant way beyond what they 
have been studying in statistics. Students can demonstrate extension in one or more 
dimensions:  
● deepening understanding – where a student explores a topic in greater depth than in 
the specification content. This could be an in-depth exploration of one aspect of the broad 
pre-release context 
● broadening skills – where a student learns a new skill. This might be learning how to 
design a website or learning a new statistical technique that can be used in the analysis of 
either primary or secondary data collected by the student  
● widening perspectives – where the student’s project spans different subjects. A student 
studying statistics with geography may wish to research the impact of tourism on a 
particular region or locality. A student studying statistics with may wish to use statistical 
techniques to analyse market data and research one aspect of a market in more detail.  
A wide range of information to support the delivery and assessment of the Extended Project, 
including the specification, teacher guidance for all aspects, an editable scheme of work and 
exemplars for all four approaches, can be found on our website.
