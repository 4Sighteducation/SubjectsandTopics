1 Introduction 
Why choose Pearson Edexcel A Level Religious 
Studies? 
We have listened to feedback from all parts of the religious studies community, including 
higher education. We have used this opportunity of curriculum change to redesign 
qualifications to reflect the demands of a truly modern and evolving religious studies 
environment. This new qualification will allow students to apply a wide range of concepts 
enabling them to confidently interpret, contextualise and analyse the expressions of religions 
and world views they encounter. 
Clear and coherent structure – our qualification offers a choice of three from the following 
four components - Philosophy of Religion, Religion and Ethics, New Testament Studies and a 
study of a chosen religion. All of the components are assessed through an externally 
examined paper which follow the same structure. 
Develops understanding and appreciation – this qualification encourages students to 
develop an appreciation of religious thought and its contribution to individuals, communities 
and societies. The qualification does this through an enquiring, critical and reflective 
approach to the study of religion.  
Helps develop a holistic understanding of religion – the specification facilitates enquiry 
into, and develops insightful evaluations of, ultimate questions about the purposes and 
commitments of human life, especially as expressed in philosophy, ethics and religion. The 
qualification encourages students to make connections so that in each field of study they 
understand the influences over time of developments in religious beliefs and practices, the 
philosophy of religion, religious ethics and/or textual interpretation. 
Provides a focus on scholarship – in the second year of study the specification content 
encourages students to compare the significant ideas presented in works of scholars selected 
from the fields of philosophy, ethics and religion. This will enable students to reflect on and 
develop their values, opinions and attitudes in the light of their studies. 
Develops transferable skills for progression to higher education – students will use 
ideas from a range of approaches to the study of religions and beliefs in order to research 
and present a wide range of well-informed and reasonable arguments, which engage 
profoundly with moral, religious and spiritual issues. This will enable students to make a 
smooth transition to the next level of study. 
Supports progression from Key Stage 4 – the content builds on the understanding 
developed at Key Stage 4, while also ensuring that students new to the subject are 
appropriately supported. 
AS and A Level qualifications that are co-teachable – co-teaching AS and A Level 
provides flexibility for you and your students. Centres co-teaching AS and A Level can deliver 
the first three topics in each component in the first year, allowing students to be entered for 
the AS at the end of year.

Paper 1: Philosophy of Religion 
Overview 
The content for this paper helps students to explore some of the main contemporary 
philosophical issues and questions about religion, such as belief in God or the conviction  
that life has both meaning and purpose. It provides a relevant and challenging context for 
exploring the particular beliefs, values and practices that characterise religious communities. 
In turn, the paper provides a sound basis for understanding and reflecting on the 
contemporary influence of religion, the views of those who do not share a religious belief and 
the impact of these factors on people’s lives. 
Students will engage with arguments and debates on religious and non-religious views of life, 
which focus on some key areas of controversy that shape modern views of the world, such as 
the problem of evil and suffering. Students will extend their understanding through 
engagement in debates on issues such as the value of evidence based on accounts of 
religious experience. They will analyse and evaluate particular viewpoints of thinkers who 
have contributed to these debates. 
Students will extend the breadth and depth of their study by considering how religious ideas 
are expressed and communicated, and how they may differ from other contemporary ways 
of expressing beliefs about the world – for instance whether religious and scientific language 
is incompatible or complementary, whether ideas about life after death are tenable in or 
relevant to the modern world. As part of this process, students will study how ideas about 
the philosophy of religion have changed over time, and the most important influences on this 
process. They will use the writings of key scholars to explore differing viewpoints about the 
development of ideas in the philosophy of religion. These studies will give students the 
opportunity to explore links between this paper and other areas of study, such as 
the impact of beliefs and values on modern life, the importance of tradition in 
religious communities or the interpretation and application of religious texts in the 
modern world. 
It is compulsory for students to compare the work of two named scholars, including a specific 
extract of their work. The list of extracts at the end of the paper must be studied by all 
students and this includes the work of two named scholars for comparison. These are 
published in the A Level Religious Studies Anthology: Paper 1 – Philosophy of Religion which 
can be downloaded from our website. The context in which these texts could be studied is 
indicated by bracketed numbers in the detailed content, (1) for example. These extracts are 
not exclusive to the topic areas under which they appear; students will need to be able to 
apply these extracts across any suitable topic. This allows for a range of questions, including 
text or language specific, as well as thematic. 
In this paper, students will be required to study the ideas of key contributors in relation to 
specific content areas. These are indicated against each relevant sub-topic. Students will be 
required to use these ideas to support and underpin their knowledge and understanding. 
Overall, this study will enhance students’ capacity to deal with controversial issues about 
beliefs and values, to have confidence in their ability to express their ideas and to put 
forward their own beliefs and ideals supported by reasoned argument and evidence.

Paper 2: Religion and Ethics 
Overview 
The content for this paper is focused on exploring both common ground and controversy in 
dealing with issues that arise in the areas of morality and religion in the context of the 
modern world. The paper will help students to study some of the underlying ideas and 
concepts of these issues, as well as questions and issues about how ethical and religious 
ideas and solutions may be applied in practice in contemporary social, political and personal 
situations. The study addresses an important part of the key underlying concerns that 
students raise about the world in which they are growing up, and about their own views, 
opinions and commitments. 
In this paper, students will study issues and practical problems such as equality, war and 
peace and sexual ethics. These issues and problems will provide a sufficient balance of 
breadth and depth for students to acquire the skills they need to address a wide range of 
contemporary moral dilemmas and to progress to further study. A representative array of 
ethical stances provides a basis for discussion and debate about major issues. This is further 
sharpened by engagement with the views and stances of significant ethical thinkers who 
have contributed to the debates. 
Students will extend the breadth and depth of their study by engaging in debates about how 
underlying factors, such as language, are relevant in discussing moral issues, and whether 
there is common ground between religion and morality. This element is considered in the 
wider context of influences that have helped to shape modern ethical theory. Students at this 
level will consider, and respond to, the contrasting views of key scholars to broaden their 
awareness of the underlying issues. These studies will give students the opportunity to 
explore links between this paper and other areas of study, such as issues about 
concepts in relation to philosophy or about beliefs and values in relation to the 
study of a particular religion. A strong focus on understanding ethical theory is applied  
at this level to issues in medical ethics, considered in the context of debates about the 
beginning and ending of life.

Paper 3: New Testament Studies 
Overview 
The content for this paper comprises a study of extended textual material. This study is set 
in a historical context so that students can become familiar with some of the more technical 
language and terminology used in the texts. It is also set in the context of the specific study 
of the Gospel texts, and involves a detailed understanding of the nature of selected passages 
of text as well as the scholarly and critical methods used today to study the text of the New 
Testament. There is a focus on understanding the Gospel teaching about how the first 
Christians understood the New Testament text and how they expressed and interpreted the 
relationship between Jesus and God. 
Students will develop and extend their familiarity with the Gospel texts themselves and with 
the critical study of Christian beliefs about the status of the Bible and about Christian 
understanding of the meaning of the texts. They will be able to consider the views of 
important interpreters of the texts and contributors to the debate about the authority of the 
Bible in the Christian Church. These studies will give students the opportunity to 
explore links between this paper and other areas of study, for example in relation 
to key Christian beliefs about the Trinity, Christian values in relation to the study of 
Ethics or the miracles of Jesus in relation to philosophical issues about their 
credibility. 
It is compulsory for students to compare the work of two named scholars, including a specific 
extract of their work. The list of extracts at the end of the paper must be studied by all 
students and this includes the work of two named scholars for comparison. These are 
published in the A level Religious Studies Anthology: Paper 3 – New Testament Studies, 
which can be downloaded from our website. The context in which these texts could be 
studied is indicated by bracketed numbers in the detailed content, (1) for example. These 
extracts are not exclusive to the topic areas under which they appear; students will need to 
be able to apply these extracts across any suitable topic.  
This allows for a range of questions, including text or language specific, as well as thematic. 
In this paper, students will be required to study the ideas of key contributors in relation to 
specific content areas. These are indicated against each relevant sub-topic. Students will be 
required to use these ideas to support and underpin their knowledge and understanding. 
Overall, this study should give students the critical and scholarly tools they need to explore 
the Gospels. The study will also give them an understanding of how the early Christian 
communities understood Jesus and how Christians today interpret and apply the texts as a 
key source of authority.

Paper 4: Study of Religion 
Overview 
The content for this paper comprises a focused and in-depth study of a chosen religion. The 
study provides a foundation for understanding the key beliefs and values of a religion, 
recognising that ‘belief’ itself does not necessarily have the same role and emphasis in 
religions or between religions. The study helps students explore how believers attribute 
authority both to key people in the religious community and to various kinds of traditional, 
sacred texts. This study also explores various and diverse ways in which religious believers 
express their sense of identity through, for example, their most sacred rituals and their 
codes of behaviour. It gives students an opportunity to explore both common ground and 
diversity in the religious tradition. They will broaden their understanding through familiarity 
with the views of various contributors, from within and outside the tradition, who have 
studied this religion in some depth. 
Students will deepen and extend their understanding of their chosen religion by studying an 
aspect of the way in which the religion has changed and developed over time, so that they 
increase their awareness of diversity within traditions. This aspect of development will reflect 
the particular focus, concerns, emphases and values of the tradition concerned. Further 
depth of study is provided by a study of key scholars who have made a significant 
contribution, either historically or in the present, to an understanding of what it means to be 
a follower of this religion. Further breadth is added by giving students the opportunity to 
explore the interface between the religion and contemporary society. Students will explore a 
passage of text that is influential in the tradition of this religion. These studies will give 
students the opportunity to explore links between this paper and other areas of 
study, such as exploring common ground and diversity in the fields of philosophy 
and ethics. 
It is compulsory for students to compare the work of two named scholars, including a specific 
extract of their work. The list of extracts at the end of the paper must be studied by all 
students and this includes the work of two named scholars for comparison. These are 
published in the relevant pages of the A Level Religious Studies Anthology, which can be 
downloaded from our website. The context in which these texts could be studied is indicated 
by bracketed numbers in the detailed content, (1) for example. These extracts are not 
exclusive to the topic areas under which they appear; students will need to be able to apply 
these extracts across any suitable topic. This allows for a range of questions, including text

Synoptic assessment 
Synoptic assessment requires students to work across different parts of a qualification and to 
show their accumulated knowledge and understanding of a topic or subject area. 
Synoptic assessment enables students to show their ability to combine their skills, knowledge 
and understanding with breadth and depth of the subject. 
Students will be able to demonstrate this through the extended essay in Question 4.

Entries 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our UK Information Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers and is 
available on our website qualifications.pearson.com 
Forbidden combinations and discount code 
There is one forbidden combination of options in this qualification, which is enforced through 
entry codes. This relates to Paper 3: New Testament Studies and Paper 4B: Christianity. 
Centres should be aware that students who enter for more than one GCE qualification with 
the same discount code will have only one of the grades they achieve counted for the 
purpose of the School and College Performance Tables – normally the better grade  
(please see Appendix 5: Codes). 
Students should be advised that, if they take two qualifications with the same discount code, 
colleges, universities and employers are very likely to take the view that they have achieved 
only one of the two GCEs. The same view may be taken if students take two GCE 
qualifications that have different discount codes but which have significant overlap of 
content. Students or their advisers who have any doubts about their subject combinations 
should check with the institution to which they wish to progress before embarking on their 
programmes. 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, 
special consideration and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
● students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
● all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will be available in English. All student work must be in 
English. 
Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to: 
● access the assessment 
● show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment. 
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Religious Studies  
Specification – Issue 3 – May 2018 © Pearson Education Limited 2018 
73 
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability, without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under the 
Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment. 
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable adjustments 
where a person with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in undertaking an 
assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps to overcome 
that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular person may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
which will include: 
● the needs of the student with the disability 
● the effectiveness of the adjustment 
● the cost of the adjustment; and 
● the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation, timeframes or affects the security or integrity of the assessment. This is 
because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a student's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the 
examination/assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material 
effect on a candidate’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate their level of attainment 
in an assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements 
and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
consideration, please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk.

Malpractice 
Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in examinations must be reported to Pearson using a JCQ Form M1 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to Investigations Team, Pearson, 190 High Holborn, 
London, WC1V 7BH. Please provide as much information and supporting documentation as 
possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice. 
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the 
integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on  
a JCQ Form M2(a) (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form, 
supporting documentation and as much information as possible can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to Investigations Team, Pearson,  
190 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BH. Note that the final decision regarding  
appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson.

Appendix 2: The context for the 
development of this qualification 
All our qualifications are designed to meet our World Class Qualification Principles[1] and our 
ambition to put the student at the heart of everything we do. 
We have developed and designed this qualification by: 
● reviewing other curricula and qualifications to ensure that it is comparable with those 
taken in high-performing jurisdictions overseas 
● consulting with key stakeholders on content and assessment, including learned bodies, 
subject associations, higher-education academics and teachers to ensure this qualification 
is suitable for a UK context 
● reviewing the legacy qualification and building on its positive attributes. 
This qualification has also been developed to meet criteria stipulated by Ofqual in GCE 
Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements and GCE Subject Level Conditions and 
Requirements for Religious Studies, published in June 2015. 
 
                                          
[1] Pearson’s World Class Qualification Principles ensure that our qualifications are: 
● demanding, through internationally benchmarked standards, encouraging deep learning and 
measuring higher-order skills 
● rigorous, through setting and maintaining standards over time, developing reliable and valid 
assessment tasks and processes, and generating confidence in end users of the knowledge, skills 
and competencies of certified students 
● inclusive, through conceptualising learning as continuous, recognising that students develop at 
different rates and have different learning needs, and focusing on progression 
● empowering, through promoting the development of transferable skills, see Appendix 3.

From Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class Qualifications 
May 2014 
“ The reform of the qualifications system in England is a profoundly important change to the 
education system. Teachers need to know that the new qualifications will assist them in helping 
their learners make progress in their lives. 
When these changes were first proposed we were approached by Pearson to join an ‘Expert 
Panel’ that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. 
We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of our 
experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe. 
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification development 
process that has included:  
● extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-performing 
jurisdictions in the world 
● benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they are at the 
right level of demand 
● establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications 
● subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual accreditation 
criteria in advance of submission.  
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented. The 
design has been guided by what is called an ‘Efficacy Framework’, meaning learner outcomes 
have been at the heart of this development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s 
success in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have 
supported the development of qualifications that are outstanding for their coherence, 
thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as representing world-class best 
practice. ”

Appendix 3: Transferable skills 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned and 
that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and can be 
built upon and extended through learning.’ [1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework as the most evidence-based and 
robust skills framework. We adapted the framework slightly to include the Program for 
International Student Assessment (PISA) ICT Literacy and Collaborative Problem Solving 
(CPS) Skills. 
The adapted National Research Council’s framework of skills involves: [2]  
Cognitive skills 
● Non-routine problem solving – expert thinking, metacognition, creativity. 
● Systems thinking – decision making and reasoning. 
● Critical thinking – definitions of critical thinking are broad and usually involve general 
cognitive skills such as analysing, synthesising and reasoning skills. 
● ICT literacy – access, manage, integrate, evaluate, construct and communicate. [3]  
Interpersonal skills 
● Communication – active listening, oral communication, written communication, assertive 
communication and non-verbal communication. 
● Relationship-building skills – teamwork, trust, intercultural sensitivity, service 
orientation, self-presentation, social influence, conflict resolution and negotiation. 
● Collaborative problem solving – establishing and maintaining shared understanding, 
taking appropriate action, establishing and maintaining team organisation. 
Intrapersonal skills 
● Adaptability – ability and willingness to cope with the uncertain, handling work stress, 
adapting to different personalities, communication styles and cultures, and physical 
adaptability to various indoor and outdoor work environments. 
● Self-management and self-development – ability to work remotely in virtual teams, 
work autonomously, be self-motivating and self-monitoring, willing and able to acquire 
new information and skills related to work. 
Transferable skills enable young people to face the demands of further and higher education, 
as well as the demands of the workplace, and are important in the teaching and learning of 
this qualification. We will provide teaching and learning materials, developed with 
stakeholders, to support our qualifications.

The Extended Project is a stand-alone qualification that can be taken alongside GCEs. It 
supports the development of independent learning skills and helps to prepare students for 
their next step – whether that be university study or employment. The qualification: 
● is recognised by universities for the skills it develops 
● is worth half of an Advanced GCE qualification at grades A*–E 
● carries UCAS points for university entry. 
The Extended Project encourages students to develop skills in the following areas: research, 
critical thinking, extended writing and project management. Students identify and agree a 
topic area of their choice for in-depth study (which may or may not be related to a GCE 
subject they are already studying), guided by their teacher. 
Students can choose from one of four approaches to produce: 
● a dissertation (for example an investigation based on predominately secondary research)  
● an investigation/field study (for example a practical experiment) 
● a performance (for example in music, drama or sport) 
● an artefact (for example creating a sculpture in response to a client brief or solving an 
engineering problem). 
The qualification is coursework based and students are assessed on the skills of managing, 
planning and evaluating their project. Students will research their topic, develop skills to 
review and evaluate the information, and then present the final outcome of their project. 
The Extended Project has 120 guided learning hours (GLH) consisting of a 40-GLH taught 
element that includes teaching the technical skills (for example research skills) and an  
80-GLH guided element that includes mentoring students through the project work. The 
qualification is 100% internally assessed and externally moderated. 
How to link the Extended Project with Religious Studies 
The Extended Project creates the opportunity to develop transferable skills for progression to 
higher education and to the workplace, through the exploration of either an area of personal 
interest or a topic of interest from the religious studies qualification content. 
Through the Extended Project students will develop skills that support their study of religion, 
including: 
● conducting, organising and using research 
● independent reading in the subject area 
● planning, project management and time management 
● developing a research brief as the basis of investigations 
● collecting, handling and interpreting evidence 
● critical thinking 
● adopting an enquiring, critical and reflective approach to the study of religion 
● reflecting on and developing their own values, opinions and attitudes in the light of their 
study 
● developing an understanding and appreciation of religious thought and its contribution to 
individuals, communities and societies.

In the context of the Extended Project, critical thinking refers to the ability to identify and 
develop arguments for a point of view and to consider and respond to alternative arguments. 
This supports the development of evaluative skills, as students critically analyse and evaluate 
the views and arguments of scholars/academics as well as constructing well-informed and 
reasoned arguments substantiated by relevant evidence. 
Types of Extended Project related to religious studies 
Students may produce a dissertation on any topic that can be researched and argued, for 
example a controversial ethical issue such as euthanasia or challenges to religious belief, or 
the religious, cultural and other significance of religious texts including their reception and 
influence beyond a religious community. 
A dissertation might involve an investigation such as: 
● major issues, challenges and questions within and about the study of religion (for example 
the role of tolerance, respect and recognition and interreligious dialogue, methods of 
study, relevance to contemporary society) and responses to these 
● how religious texts and/or other relevant sources of wisdom and authority are interpreted 
and applied 
The dissertation uses the ideas of scholars to provide a reasoned defence or a point of view, 
with consideration of counter-arguments. 
An alternative might be an investigative project involving the collection of evidence from 
primary research, for example a case study of inter-faith relations in Bradford. 
Using the Extended Project to support breadth and depth 
In the Extended Project, students are assessed on the quality of the work they produce and 
the skills they develop and demonstrate through completing this work. Students should 
demonstrate that they have extended themselves in some significant way beyond what they 
have been studying in Religious Studies. Students can demonstrate extension in one or more 
dimensions: 
● deepening understanding – where a student explores a topic in greater depth than in 
the specification content. This could be an in-depth exploration of scepticism in David 
Hume’s ‘Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion’ 
● broadening skills – where a student learns a new skill. This might be linking theology 
with New Testament studies such as an investigation into Albert Schweitzer’s claim that 
Jesus is embedded in the presuppositions of the Gospel writers and subsequent 
commentators and thus he remains as ‘One unknown’ 
● widening perspectives – where the student’s project spans different subjects. A student 
studying Religious Studies with Sociology may wish to research the appeal and problems 
associated with new religious movements. A student studying Religious Studies with 
History may wish to use the implications of diversity of religious beliefs in the Middle East. 
A wide range of information to support the delivery and assessment of the Extended Project, 
including the specification, teacher guidance for all aspects, an editable scheme of work and 
exemplars for all four approaches, can be found on our website.
