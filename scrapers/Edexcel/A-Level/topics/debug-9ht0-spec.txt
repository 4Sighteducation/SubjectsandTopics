1 Introduction 
Why choose Pearson Edexcel A Level History of Art? 
We’ve listened to feedback from all parts of the History of Art community, including teachers, 
subject associations and higher education. We’ve used this opportunity of curriculum change 
to redesign this qualification so that it reflects the demands of a truly evolving environment 
allowing us to design a qualification that enables your students to engage with the breadth 
and depth of this inspiring subject. This course develops students understanding of the 
relationship between society and art; art historical terms, concepts and issues; the influence 
of cultural, social and political factors as well as developments in materials, techniques and 
processes of both art and architecture over time.  
Core visual literary skills - The initial Visual Analysis topic delivers the core skills of visual 
literacy and understanding, vital skill in today’s visual world.  
Global scope - The inclusion works from beyond the European tradition in the thematic 
topics introduces a global scope into the syllabus that is appropriate for the modern world. 
Local perspectives – Allowing centres to choose which works to teach will allow them to 
make use of their local museums and galleries.  
Opportunities for breadth and depth - The five Periods give the opportunity to study 
some of the most significant and exciting eras of art and architecture in depth. Students will 
continue to build on and develop their skills of visual literacy and their knowledge base as 
they expand from the breadth of the Themes to the greater detail of Periods.  
Clear assessments - This new A Level offers clear assessment, allowing students the 
opportunity to engage in debate and evaluate ideas.  
Access to cultural heritage - Over the two-year course, students will develop the skills 
and understanding to enjoy a lifetime of access to, and appreciation of, the culture, heritage 
and ideas of the world around them.  
Supports progression to further study - All elements of this course equip students with 
skills for higher education and beyond: art history’s inter-disciplinary benefits are key to this, 
as are the requirements for all students to learn to analyse, research and to create 
substantiated reasoned argument in written form.

2 Subject content 
The study of art in its historical and contemporary forms gives students crucial knowledge of 
world civilisations. It gives students visual and analytical skills that can be applied in many 
walks of life and the tools to understand how images and objects work to shape our social 
and political identities. This specification allows students to develop particular strengths and 
interests, encourages lifelong learning and provides access to higher education and 
university degree courses in art history and related subjects, as well as art historical-related 
and other careers. Students should be encouraged to research and investigate art through 
first-hand experience. 
The subject content is divided into three areas: 
● A: Visual analysis 
● B: Themes 
● C: Periods. 
Qualification aims and objectives 
The aims and objectives of this qualification are to enable students to:  
● engage actively and independently in historical, theoretical and critical study of art 
● be encouraged, where possible, to research and investigate art through first-hand 
experience of works of art 
● understand the relationship between society, culture, technology, politics and art 
● understand the ways in which art has been used and interpreted by past and present 
societies 
● understand the influences on, and contributions of, artists 
● know key art historical terms, concepts and issues 
● understand how visual language is used by artists to communicate ideas, including formal 
characteristics, materials, techniques, and processes 
● be able to analyse and make critical judgements about art 
● use evidence to substantiate structured arguments about art 
● study a sufficient range of artists and works of art to ensure an appropriate depth and 
breadth of knowledge and understanding of specified movements/periods and themes. 
Knowledge and understanding 
All students must develop the ability to apply their knowledge and understanding in 
evidenced, structured arguments across all investigation areas. These cover: 
● art historical terms and concepts 
● influential artists and art of key historical movements, periods, styles and types of art 
● changes in art over time, including: the influence of cultural, social, political and 
technological factors on relevant works of art, artists and movements/periods

A: Visual analysis 
Overview 
Throughout this qualification, students will develop the understanding and ability to 
undertake effective visual analysis. The ability to analyse the formal characteristics of any 
work of art and architecture is a key advantage for any individual in a world dominated by 
visual images and messages. It is, therefore, a valuable life skill. 
This visual literacy is developed by building knowledge and understanding of key 
terminology, and the ability to analyse and interpret the choices made by artists in their art. 
This interpretation spans an understanding of the effects and impacts of the application of 
formal characteristics, underpinned by a general knowledge and understanding of historical, 
social and cultural contexts. Students will develop the ability to link these elements in the 
creation of sustained critical argument, which is supported by detailed evidence and 
reasoning and close reading of images. 
Students will develop visual literacy across painting, sculpture and architecture from within 
the European tradition of art, from Classical Greece (500 BCE) to the present. This core skill 
will enable students to go on to analyse artists’ work to identify more complex 
interdependencies between visual language and the effects achieved. 
Visual analysis is assessed specifically in Paper 1 Section A but students will also draw on 
these skills when answering questions on Themes and Periods.

B: Themes 
Overview 
Two Themes must be selected from the three options: 
● B1 Nature in art and architecture 
● B2 Identities in art and architecture 
● B3 War in art and architecture. 
These Themes are intended to be broad-based explorations of the developments in art and 
connections between movements and periods across time and place. Therefore, all students 
must explore artists and works from both pre- and post-1850 and from both within and 
beyond the European tradition. The detail of coverage is given for each Theme on the 
following pages. Students must study work across at least three types of art: 2D, 3D and 
architecture. 
Each Theme sets out the requirements for works to be selected. An example of a set of 
works that fulfil these requirements for Theme B1 Nature in art and architecture can be 
found in Appendix 2: Exemplar selection of works. 
Appendix 4 summarises the number of works to be studied across the Themes. 
Critical texts 
Students must explore Key Topic 4 (b) for each chosen Theme in relation to at least one 
critical text. A different critical text must be used for each Theme, and these must be 
different from those used for the Periods. 
● A critical text is one which provides views that students may integrate in support of, or 
counter to, their own argument. It may derive from interpretations offered by 
contemporary or subsequent named critics (including art historians). It is thus 
differentiated from a purely factual source of information about a work of art, artist or its 
context.  
● All students must know and understand at least one critical text in detail. However, 
different texts (or extracts) may be used for individual artists, as long as the student 
develops the body of knowledge and understanding of key secondary source/s to support 
their learning. 
● If the text does not cover both of the chosen specified artists and the chosen specified 
architect, then additional text(s) will be required. 
● The choice of texts is at the discretion of the teacher and/or student.  
● Material from books, articles, documentaries and podcasts are acceptable, as long as 
examiners are able to verify the named critic referenced by students in the examination. 
● In the assessment, students may refer to the authors of their critical texts by quotation or 
by summarising their views.

C: Periods 
Overview 
Two Periods must be selected from the five options: 
C1 Invention and illusion: the Renaissance in Italy (1420‒1520) 
C2 Power and persuasion: the Baroque in Catholic Europe (1597‒1685) 
C3 Rebellion and revival: the British and French Avant-Garde (1848‒99) 
C4 Brave new world: Modernism in Europe (1900‒39) 
C5 Pop life: British and American contemporary art and architecture (1960‒2015). 
The study of a Period is intended to allow students the opportunity to research and explore in 
detail the key movements, concepts, artists, architects, contextual factors and related 
developments of art and architecture in a specific place/s and across a clearly defined time 
frame. 
Appendix 4 summarises the number of works to be studied across the Periods. 
Critical texts 
Students must explore Key Topic 4 (b) for each chosen Period in relation to at least one 
critical text. A different critical text must be used for each Period, and these must be 
different from those used for the Themes. 
● A critical text is one which provides views that students may integrate in support of, or 
counter to, their own argument. It may derive from interpretations offered by 
contemporary or subsequent named critics (including art historians). It is thus 
differentiated from a purely factual source of information about a work of art, artist or its 
context.  
● All students must know and understand at least one critical text in detail. However, 
different texts (or extracts) may be used for individual artists, as long as the student 
develops the body of knowledge and understanding of key secondary source/s to support 
their learning. 
● If the text does not cover both of the chosen specified artists, then additional text(s) will 
be required. 
● The choice of text is at the discretion of the teacher and/or student.  
● Material from books, articles, documentaries and podcasts are acceptable, as long as 
examiners are able to verify the named critic referenced by students in the examination. 
● In the assessment, students may refer to the authors of their critical texts by quotation or 
by summarising their views.

C1 Invention and illusion: the Renaissance in Italy (1420‒1520) 
This option spans one of the most extraordinary concentrations of artistic achievement the 
world has ever seen. The ideas, values and iconic works of the Italian Renaissance continue 
to shape ideas of beauty, perfection and heritage today. Beginning with the innovative 
challenges of Masaccio in Florence, students can explore the cultural contexts of the 
Renaissance through, among others, the work of Donatello, Brunelleschi, Bellini and 
Michelangelo. 
Students must consider the impact of different styles, materials and techniques of the time 
as well as exploring and evaluating the impact of the regional historical events, philosophical 
developments and the changing status of artists, architects and patrons on art and 
architecture. 
This option covers the work produced in the regions and cities of the three states of Venice 
(which can include Padua and Mantua), Florence (which can include Siena) and Rome. 
Selection of works 
Works by specified artists 
From the table below, choose one specified artist from each type, with three works by each 
(six works in total). The works and artists must be studied in detail. 
Painting/2D art (choose one) Sculpture/3D art (choose one) 
Giovanni Bellini (1430–1516) 
Sandro Botticelli (1445–1510) 
Raphael (1483–1520) 
Donatello (1386–1466) 
Tullio Lombardo (1460–1532 
Michelangelo (1475–1564) 
Additional works 
Choose at least 12 additional works from relevant artists and architects of your choice. This 
may include works from the artists above, if not already selected as ‘specified’ artists. 
Additional works by specified artists in other types may also be studied (for example if 
Michelangelo is selected as a ‘specified’ artist, three sculptures must be studied in detail, but 
additional works by him in painting or architecture may also be studied). 
Ensuring coverage of the topic content 
The specified and additional works must collectively provide full coverage of the 
requirements specified in the content table on the following page. 
For each of the six categories (a)–(f) listed next to Scope of works, at least one work must 
be studied that was produced in each of the three city regions. 
In this Period, the requirement is to cover works produced in (or for) each of the city states 
or regions. This means that works by Michelangelo may be used to explore the art and 
architecture of both Florence and Rome, and students would need to know and understand 
the impact of both location and patronage of works in each region. 
Teachers must select works that fall clearly within the years 1420‒1520, even if the 
artists/architects also worked outside these years. 
It is important to note that works chosen for this Period cannot be studied in any of  
the Themes.

C2 Power and persuasion: the Baroque in Catholic Europe  
(1597–1685) 
In this option, students investigate the impact of the rise of Protestantism and the Catholic 
Counter Reformation on art and architecture. The political face of Europe changed 
dramatically too, and students will explore the context of work across a variety of genres and 
for a variety of uses. 
This option offers an in-depth study of the art and architecture of the Italian states as well as 
selected artists and works from other Baroque Catholic countries (for example France, Spain, 
the Spanish Netherlands or Austria) in comparison. Students will explore the impact of 
religious, historical and philosophical factors on art and its audiences of monarchs, nobility, 
individuals and groups across the region. 
Selection of works 
Works by specified artists 
From the table below, choose one specified artist from each type, with three works by each 
(six works in total). The works and artists must be studied in detail. 
Painting/2D art (choose one) Sculpture/3D art (choose one) 
Caravaggio (1571–1610) 
Peter Paul Rubens (1577‒1640) 
Diego Velázquez (1599–1660) 
Juan Martinez Montañés (1568–1649) 
Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598–1680) 
Pierre Puget (1620–94) 
Additional works 
Choose at least 12 additional works from relevant artists and architects of your choice.  
This may include works from the artists above, if not already selected as ‘specified’ artists. 
Additional works by specified artists in other types may also be studied (for example if 
Bernini is selected as a ‘specified’ artist, three sculptures must be studied in detail, but 
additional works of his in painting or architecture may also be studied). 
Ensuring coverage of the topic content 
The specified and additional works must collectively provide full coverage of the 
requirements specified in the content table on the following page. 
For each of the nine categories (a)–(i) listed next to Scope of works, at least one work must 
be studied that was produced by an Italian artist and at least one by an artist from a second 
European Catholic country. The ‘other’ country can vary across categories (so, for example,  
a Spanish artist might be chosen for category (a) but a French artist for (b)). 
In this Period, the identification of artists is by their nationality. Therefore, Bernini is always 
considered to be an Italian artist, even when working for Louis XIV in France. Similarly, 
Claude, Puget and Poussin are French artists, even when working in Italy. Rubens is a 
Flemish artist throughout his career, even though he works in many different European 
countries. 
Teachers must select works that fall clearly within the years 1597–1685, even if the 
artists/architects also worked outside these years. 
It is important to note that works chosen for this Period cannot be studied in any of  
the Themes.

C3 Rebellion and revival: the British and French Avant-Garde 
(1848–99) 
Was it the spirit of the 1848 rebellions that sparked the extraordinary originality and 
inventiveness of art and architecture in the second half of the nineteenth century? As Europe 
responded to a time of industrial change, technological advances made the world feel faster, 
more exhilarating and also more disorientating. It was often the creative work of artists and 
architects that demonstrated the inspiration or challenges of this ‘progress’ to the world. 
This option offers students the opportunity to explore the works of the Impressionists and 
Post-Impressionists as well as those of the Victorian, Pre-Raphaelite and Art Nouveau 
movements in Britain and France. Students will look closely at the profound social, political 
and technological changes of this era and explore and evaluate their impact on artists and 
their art. 
Selection of works 
Works by specified artists 
From the table below, choose one specified artist from each type, with three works by each 
(six works in total). The works and artists must be studied in detail.

Alfred Gilbert (1854–1934) 
Additional works 
Choose at least 12 additional works from relevant artists and architects of your choice.  
This may include works from the artists above, if not already selected as ‘specified’ artists. 
Additional works by specified artists in other types may also be studied (for example if Degas 
is selected as a ‘specified’ artist, three sculptures must be studied in detail, but additional 
works of his in painting may also be studied). 
Ensuring coverage of the topic content 
The specified and additional works must collectively provide full coverage of the 
requirements specified in the content table on the following page. 
For each of the nine categories (a)–(i) listed next to Scope of works, at least one work must 
be studied that was produced by a British artist and at least one by a French artist  
In this Period, the identification of artists is by their nationality1. Therefore, Monet is a 
French artist, even when working in England. Holman Hunt is a British artist and all his works 
may be studied, even those produced internationally. For the purpose of this specification, 
Pissarro and Sisley are both considered to be French artists. 
Teachers must select works that fall clearly within the years 1848–1899, even if the 
artists/architects also worked outside these years. 
It is important to note that works chosen for this Period cannot be studied in any of  
the Themes. 
                                                
1  Van Gogh is a Dutch artist and therefore cannot be included in this Period. He may be cited as an 
influential artist but the key works to be studied must be by French and British artists. He is, 
however, a specified artist in the Theme Identities in Art. Similarly, Whistler is an American artist and 
therefore falls outside this study.

C4 Brave new world: Modernism in Europe (1900–39) 
In the early years of the twentieth century, an extraordinary optimism fuelled the beginnings 
of the urban, machine age, and artists responded with startling ideas that challenged many 
of the long-established conventions in art and architecture. Gradually, this optimism gave 
way to the horrific events of the two World Wars. The creative work of artists both in France 
and across Europe demonstrate a fascinating response to profound questions about what art 
is, who art is produced for and the personal and political functions it could fulfil.  
This option has been designed to offer an in-depth investigation into the art and architecture 
of France and in comparison with the art and architecture of other European countries (for 
example Britain, Spain, Germany, Italy, Russia and the Netherlands), and the development 
of art and artists from these countries across from the time of the 1900 International 
Exhibition in Paris to the outbreak of World War II in 1939. 
Selection of works 
Works by specified artists 
From the table below, choose one specified artist from each type, with three works by each 
(six works in total). The works and artists must be studied in detail. 
Painting/2D art (choose one) Sculpture/3D art (choose one) 
Henri Matisse (1869–1954) 
Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880–1938) 
Georges Braque (1882–1963) 
Constantin Brancusi (1876–1957) 
Jacob Epstein (1880–1959) 
Alberto Giacometti (1901–66) 
Additional works 
Choose at least 12 additional works from relevant artists and architects of your choice.  
This may include works from the artists above, if not already selected as ‘specified’ artists. 
Additional works by specified artists in other types may also be studied (for example if 
Matisse is selected as a ‘specified’ artist, three paintings must be studied in detail, but 
additional works of his in sculpture may also be studied). 
Ensuring coverage of the topic content 
The specified and additional works must, collectively, provide full coverage of the 
requirements specified in the content table on the following page. 
For each of the nine categories (a)–(i) listed next to Scope of works, at least one work must 
be studied that was produced by a French artist and at least one by an artist of a different 
European nationality. The ‘other’ nationality can vary across categories (so, for example,  
a German artist might be chosen for category (a) but an Italian artist for category (b)). 
In this Period, the identification of artists is by their nationality. Therefore, Duchamp is a 
French artist, even when working in the USA. Picasso is a Spanish artist, even when working 
in France. Epstein is considered to be a British artist despite his American birth, and  
Le Corbusier is considered to be French. 
Teachers must select works which fall clearly within the years 1900–39, even if the  
artists/architects also continued working outside these years. 
It is important to note that works chosen for this Period cannot be studied in any of  
the Themes.

C5 Pop life: British and American contemporary art and 
architecture (1960–2015) 
The 1960s witnessed the expansion of consumer culture, along with widespread political 
upheaval as groups of young people expressed their opposition to a range of issues. In many 
ways, this decade laid the foundations for society today: from celebrity culture to the 
democratic claims made by some for the internet. The difficulty of finding an appropriate 
style ‘label’ is a mark of the vitality and breadth of individual expression in the art and 
architecture in these post-war years, as artists push boundaries, ask new questions and use 
their work to make us see the world afresh. 
This option explores the relationship between Britain and the USA in art and architecture, 
and the dynamic nature of responses on both sides of the Atlantic. Students will explore how 
key artists use their voice in contemporary politics, philosophy and arguments of identity, as 
well as considering the changing role of the gallery and the impact on our environment of 
architectural creations. 
Selection of works 
Works by specified artists 
From the table below, choose one specified artist from each type, with three works by each 
(six works in total). The works and artists must be studied in detail. 
Painting/2D art (choose one) Sculpture/3D art (choose one) 
Andy Warhol (1928–87) 
David Hockney (1937–) 
Chris Ofili (1968–) 
Judy Chicago (1939–) 
Mary Kelly (1941–) 
Rachel Whiteread (1963–) 
Additional works 
Choose at least 12 additional works from relevant artists and architects of your choice.  
This may include works from the artists above, if not already selected as ‘specified’ artists. 
Additional works by specified artists in other types may also be studied (for example if 
Warhol is selected as a ‘specified’ artist, three 2D works must be studied in detail, but 
additional works of his in 3D may also be studied). 
Ensuring coverage of the topic content 
The specified and additional works must, collectively, provide full coverage of the 
requirements specified in the content table on the following page. 
For each of the nine categories (a)–(i) listed next to Scope of works, at least one work must 
be studied by a British artist and at least one work by an American artist. 
In this Period, the identification of artists is by their nationality. Therefore, Mary Kelly is an 
American artist, even when working in England. David Hockney is a British artist, even when 
working in America. Chris Ofili is a British artist and all his works may be studied, even those 
produced internationally. Similarly, works of art and architecture produced by British or 
American artists/architects for international locations, events or individuals may be studied 
as part of their British or American tradition, as appropriate. 
Teachers must select works that fall clearly within the years 1960–2015, even if the 
artists/architects also continued working outside these years. 
It is important to note that works chosen for this Period cannot be studied in any of  
the Themes.

4 Administration and general information 
Entries 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our UK Information Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers and is 
available on our website: qualifications.pearson.com 
Discount code and performance tables 
Centres should be aware that students who enter for more than one GCE qualification with 
the same discount code will have only one of the grades they achieve counted for the 
purpose of the school and college performance tables. This will be the grade for the larger 
qualification (i.e. the A Level grade rather than the AS grade). If the qualifications are the 
same size, then the better grade will be counted (please see Appendix 8: Codes). 
Students should be advised that if they take two GCE qualifications with the same discount 
code, the colleges, universities and employers to which they wish to progress are likely to 
take the view that this achievement is equivalent to only one GCE. The same view may be 
taken if students take two GCE qualifications that have different discount codes but which 
have significant overlap of content. Before embarking on their programmes, students or their 
advisers who have any doubts about their subject combinations should check with the 
institution to which they wish to progress. 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, 
special consideration and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
● students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
● all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will be available in English. All student work must be  
in English. 
Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to: 
● access the assessment 
● show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment. 
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in History of Art – Specification  
– Issue 2 – June 2017 © Pearson Education Limited 2017 
36 
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability, without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under the 
Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment. 
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable adjustments 
where a person with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in undertaking an 
assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps to overcome 
that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular person may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
including: 
● the needs of the student with the disability 
● the effectiveness of the adjustment 
● the cost of the adjustment; and 
● the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation, or affects timeframes or the security or integrity of the assessment.  
This is because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a student's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the examination/ 
assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material effect on a 
candidate’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate their level of attainment in  
an assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements 
and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
consideration, please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk. 
Malpractice 
Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in History of Art – Specification –  
Issue 2 – June 2017 © Pearson Education Limited 2017 
37 
Candidate malpractice in examinations must be reported to Pearson using a JCQ Form M1 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to Investigations Team, Pearson, 190 High Holborn, 
London, WC1V 7BH. Please provide as much information and supporting documentation as 
possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice. 
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the 
integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on a  
JCQ Form M2(a) (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form, 
supporting documentation and as much information as possible can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to Investigations Team, Pearson,  
190 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BH. Note that the final decision regarding  
appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
General and Vocational Qualifications Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and 
Assessments Policies and Procedures, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice. 
Awarding and reporting 
This qualification will be graded, awarded and certificated to comply with the requirements of 
Ofqual's General Conditions of Recognition. This A Level qualification will be graded and 
certificated on a six-grade scale from A* to E using the total subject mark. Individual papers 
are not graded. 
Students whose level of achievement is below the minimum judged by Pearson to be of 
sufficient standard to be recorded on a certificate will receive an unclassified U result. 
The first certification opportunity for this qualification will be 2019. 
Student recruitment and progression 
Pearson follows the JCQ policy concerning recruitment to our qualifications in that: 
● they must be available to anyone who is capable of reaching the required standard 
● they must be free from barriers that restrict access and progression 
● equal opportunities exist for all students. 
Prior learning and other requirements 
There are no prior learning or other requirements for this qualification. No prior knowledge of 
art history is expected. 
Students who would benefit most from studying this qualification are likely to have a Level 2 
qualification such as a GCSE in Art and Design, a GCSE in History, or another humanities 
subject.

art beyond the 
European tradition  
This refers to art objects originating from cultures and societies 
across the world, e.g. Japan, China, Africa, India or the Middle East. 
For the purposes of this specification, ‘the European tradition’ 
includes the cultures and societies of Europe and the arts utilising 
European aesthetics. Therefore, arts of USA, Australia, New Zealand 
and Canada are considered part of the European tradition but the 
arts from the indigenous (or First Nation) peoples of these countries 
are referred to as ‘beyond the European tradition’. These works must 
be explored in relation to their own cultures and contexts. 
conceptual art In which the idea or concept presented by the artist is considered 
more important than the finished project. 
earth or land art Site-specific art: art in which the land and the art are inextricably 
linked. 
ethnicity An identity focused on cultural belonging to a social group with a 
specified set of traditions, expectations or conventions. Ethnicity 
does not normally embrace religious choice but in some cases  
(e.g. Judaism) this may be a valid inclusion. 
installation An art object designed for a particular space, often site-specific and 
designed to transform the perception of a space. 
man-made materials Those which are created by human intervention: such as alloys of 
bronze, silver, paper, cardboard. 
memorial sculpture A 3D work created to commemorate a person or event, usually for a 
public venue. For the sake of clarity, triumphal arches (and their 
sculptural decoration) are considered to be buildings for the purpose 
of this specification and its examinations. 
natural materials Those which are worked in their natural state, such as marble, 
alabaster, wood, ivory.

Appendix 3: Taxonomy of command words 
The table below lists the command words used in the assessments and sets out what is 
required by students. 
 
Command word(s) Requirements 
Explain 
 
Requires an answer and a reason or set of reasons. The 
answer will provide justification for reasoning based on 
analysis and interpretation of selected examples.  
Study 
 
Used as an instruction in conjunction with other command 
words. Requires analysis (breakdown or deconstruction) of 
an image or artefact, allowing for reasoned consideration, 
scrutiny and investigation of a range of factors including 
technical attributes, formal elements, contextual influences 
and relevant factual information. The answer will consider 
the interrelationship between factors. 
Discuss/Explore/Consider 
 
Requires analysis and interpretations of relevant aspects of 
the issue/element/situation/problem/concept/argument. The 
answer will apply critical judgement to formulate a reasoned 
argument, and will use subject-specific language and 
evidence to support points.  
Evaluate 
 
Requires the use of critical judgement to review and 
interpret information gained from analysis and investigation. 
The answer will bring together relevant evidence, 
interpretation and information in relation to a given context 
to form a supported conclusion.  
How far do you agree? 
 
Used where a reasoned argument and discussion based on a 
given statement is required. The answer will apply critical 
judgement to support reasoning as to why a conclusion has 
been reached, including what factors have been considered 
and how their importance and effects have been gauged.

Appendix 5: The context for the 
development of this qualification 
All our qualifications are designed to meet our World Class Qualification Principles[1] and our 
ambition to put the student at the heart of everything we do. 
We have developed and designed this qualification by: 
● consulting with key stakeholders on content and assessment, including the Association of 
Art Historians, museums, galleries and teachers to ensure that the qualification is suitable 
for a UK context 
● reviewing the legacy qualification and building on its positive attributes. 
This qualification has also been developed to meet criteria stipulated by Ofqual in their 
documents GCE Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements and GCE Subject Level 
Conditions and Requirements for History of Art, published in March 2016. 
                                                
[1] Pearson’s World Class Qualification Principles ensure that our qualifications are: 
● demanding, through internationally benchmarked standards, encouraging deep learning and 
measuring higher-order skills 
● rigorous, through setting and maintaining standards over time, developing reliable and valid 
assessment tasks and processes, and generating confidence in end users of the knowledge, skills 
and competencies of certified students 
● inclusive, through conceptualising learning as continuous, recognising that students develop at 
different rates and have different learning needs, and focusing on progression 
● empowering, through promoting the development of transferable skills, see Appendix 6.

From Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class Qualifications 
May 2014 
“The reform of the qualifications system in England is a profoundly important change to the 
education system. Teachers need to know that the new qualifications will assist them in 
helping their learners make progress in their lives. 
When these changes were first proposed we were approached by Pearson to join an ‘Expert 
Panel’ that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. 
We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of 
our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe. 
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification development 
process that has included: 
● extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-performing 
jurisdictions in the world 
● benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they are at 
the right level of demand 
● establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications 
● subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual 
accreditation criteria in advance of submission.  
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented. The 
design has been guided by what is called an ‘Efficacy Framework’, meaning learner outcomes 
have been at the heart of this development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s 
success in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have 
supported the development of qualifications that are outstanding for their coherence, 
thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as representing world-class best 
practice.”

Appendix 6: Transferable skills 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned and 
that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and can be 
built upon and extended through learning.’ [1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework as the most evidence-based and 
robust skills framework. We adapted the framework slightly to include the Program for 
International Student Assessment (PISA) ICT Literacy and Collaborative Problem Solving 
(CPS) Skills. 
The adapted National Research Council’s framework of skills involves: [2]  
Cognitive skills 
● Non-routine problem solving – expert thinking, metacognition, creativity. 
● Systems thinking – decision making and reasoning. 
● Critical thinking – definitions of critical thinking are broad and usually involve general 
cognitive skills such as analysing, synthesising and reasoning skills. 
● ICT literacy – access, manage, integrate, evaluate, construct and communicate. [3]  
Interpersonal skills 
● Communication – active listening, oral communication, written communication, assertive 
communication and non-verbal communication. 
● Relationship-building skills – teamwork, trust, intercultural sensitivity, service 
orientation, self-presentation, social influence, conflict resolution and negotiation. 
● Collaborative problem solving – establishing and maintaining shared understanding, 
taking appropriate action, establishing and maintaining team organisation. 
Intrapersonal skills 
● Adaptability – ability and willingness to cope with the uncertain, handling work stress, 
adapting to different personalities, communication styles and cultures, and physical 
adaptability to various indoor and outdoor work environments. 
● Self-management and self-development – ability to work remotely in virtual teams, 
work autonomously, be self-motivating and self-monitoring, willing and able to acquire 
new information and skills related to work. 
Transferable skills enable young people to face the demands of further and higher education, 
as well as the demands of the workplace, and are important in the teaching and learning of 
this qualification. We will provide teaching and learning materials, developed with 
stakeholders, to support our qualifications.

Appendix 7: Level 3 Extended Project 
qualification 
What is the Extended Project?  
The Extended Project is a standalone qualification that can be taken alongside GCEs. It 
supports the development of independent learning skills and helps to prepare students for 
their next step – whether that be higher education or employment. The qualification:  
● is recognised by higher education for the skills it develops  
● is worth half of an Advanced GCE qualification at grades A*–E  
● carries UCAS points for university entry.  
The Extended Project encourages students to develop skills in the following areas: research, 
critical thinking, extended writing and project management. Students identify and agree a 
topic area of their choice for in-depth study (which may or may not be related to a GCE 
subject they are already studying), guided by their teacher.   
Students can choose from one of four approaches to produce:  
● a dissertation (for example an investigation based on predominately secondary research) 
● an investigation/field study (for example a practical experiment) 
● a performance (for example in music, drama or sport) 
● an artefact (for example creating a sculpture in response to a client brief or solving an 
engineering problem). 
The qualification is non-examination assessment based, and students are assessed on the 
skills of managing, planning and evaluating their project. Students will research their topic, 
develop skills to review and evaluate the information, and then present the final outcome of 
their project. 
The Extended Project has 120 guided learning hours (GLH) consisting of a 40-GLH taught 
element that includes teaching the technical skills (for example research skills) and an  
80-GLH guided element that includes mentoring students through the project work. The 
qualification is 100% internally assessed and externally moderated.  
How to link the Extended Project with history of art 
The Extended Project creates the opportunity to develop transferable skills for progression to 
higher education and to the workplace, through the exploration of either an area of personal 
interest or a topic of interest from within the History of Art qualification content. 
Through the Extended Project, students will develop skills that support their study of the 
history of art, including: 
● conducting, organising and using research 
● independent reading in the subject area 
● planning, project management and time management 
● evaluating arguments and processes 
● critical thinking skills. 
In the context of the Extended Project, critical thinking refers to the ability to identify and 
develop arguments for a point of view or hypothesis and to consider and respond to 
alternative arguments.

Types of Extended Project related to history of art 
Students may produce a dissertation on any topic that can be researched and argued,  
for example an investigation into an artist that is not being studied as part of the History  
of Art course (for example because they are from a period or location that is not covered on 
the course). The dissertation uses secondary research sources to provide a reasoned defence 
or a point of view, with consideration of counter-arguments. 
An alternative might be an artefact, for example creating an artwork inspired by the work of 
an artist, period or movement of the student’s choice in response to a client brief. 
Using the Extended Project to support breadth and depth 
In the Extended Project, students are assessed on the quality of the work they produce and 
the skills they develop and demonstrate through completing this work. Students should 
demonstrate that they have extended themselves in some significant way beyond what they 
have been studying in history of art. Students can demonstrate extension in one or more 
dimensions: 
● deepening understanding – where a student explores a topic in greater depth than in 
the specification content, for example an artist who is being studied as part of the content 
but focusing on works that are not part of the content 
● broadening skills – where a student learns a new skill, for example learning how to 
create a website dedicated to publicising an artist’s work 
● widening perspectives – where the student’s project spans different subjects. A student 
studying history of art with geography may wish to explore the role of a famous artist in 
attracting tourism to a particular region or locality. A student studying business, may wish 
to investigate the financial costs and benefits to galleries of ‘blockbuster’ exhibitions. 
A wide range of information to support the delivery and assessment of the Extended Project, 
including the specification, teacher guidance for all aspects, an editable scheme of work and 
exemplars for all four approaches, can be found on our website.
