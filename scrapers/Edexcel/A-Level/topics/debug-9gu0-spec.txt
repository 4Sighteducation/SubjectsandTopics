1 Introduction 
Why choose the Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE 
in Gujarati? 
We believe languages should appeal to all students. Our new Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE 
in Gujarati (listening, reading and writing) has been developed to inspire all students to have 
an appreciation of the language, literature, film and culture of the Gujarat state and other 
areas of India where Gujarati is spoken. 
We have listened to feedback from the languages community – subject associations, 
academics and advisors, together with teachers and students – and have designed a 
motivating course of study that will enable your students to develop advanced level 
knowledge and understanding of the Gujarati language, the culture of the Gujarat state and 
other areas of India where Gujarati is spoken, as well as practical and valuable language and 
transferable study skills. This specification will help to prepare students for higher education 
and enhance their employability profile. 
Inspiring and engaging themes – our qualification features familiar and popular themes, 
as well as some new content that provides clear links to some of the most fundamental and 
interesting aspects of the culture of the Gujarat state and other areas of India where Gujarati 
is spoken. 
Popular literary texts and films – we offer a choice of literary texts and films that includes 
contemporary and more classic titles. 
Rewards creativity – our assessments place an emphasis on communication and grammar, 
as well as providing plenty of opportunities for students to apply their knowledge 
independently and creatively. Clear mark schemes encourage students to develop ideas, use 
language to persuade and analyse, and give critical responses in their writing. 
Clear and coherent structure – our qualification has a straightforward structure with four 
engaging themes: �ુખ્ય િવષય ૧:- �ુજરાતી સમાજમાં પ�રવતર્ન; �ુખ્ય િવષય ૨: માધ્યમ અને સંસ્�ૃિત; �ુખ્ય 
િવષય ૩: તત્કાલીન �ુજરાતી સમાજના િવિવધ પાસાં ; �ુખ્ય િવષય ૪: �ુજરાતના રાજક�ય પાસાં 
The four themes are studied alongside two works (either two literary texts or one literary 
text and one film) and are assessed through three externally-examined papers.  
Manageable content – we have worked closely with teachers and students to ensure that 
our content is manageable and appropriate so that you and your students can be confident 
that you have enough time to cover what you need to at the appropriate depth. 
Continuous progression – our content builds on the understanding developed at  
Key Stage 4 and gives students the opportunity to learn and apply important transferable 
skills in critical thinking and analysis, enabling them to make a smooth transition to the next 
level of study. However, students do not need to have studied GCSE Gujarati to follow this 
course.

Themes, sub-themes and research subjects 
Papers 1, 2 and 3 will be based on content from the following four themes. 
The four themes address a range of content related to society past and present, as well as 
aspects of the political, artistic and intellectual culture of the Gujarat state and other areas of 
India where Gujarati is spoken. 
Themes 1, 3 and 4 focus on aspects of the society and political culture of the Gujarat state 
only, the principal area where Gujarati is spoken. Theme 2 focuses on political, artistic and 
intellectual culture and includes other areas of India where Gujarati is spoken, as well as the 
Gujarat state.  
Each theme is broken into two sub-themes and a research subject (highlighted in bold). Each 
sub-theme and research subject is divided into a series of different aspects. 
Students are required to select one research subject only for Paper 1. For their research, 
students must cover all three aspects of the research subject. Teachers should consider 
cultural sensitivities when giving guidance to students on selecting an appropriate research 
subject. If students choose the research subject from Themes 1, 3 or 4 they must focus their 
research on the Gujarat state only. If they choose the research subject from Theme 2, they 
will be allowed to draw on knowledge and understanding from the Gujarat state and/or other 
areas of India where Gujarati is spoken. Teachers should ensure that students focus their 
independent research on Gujarati-speaking areas of India only.

Guidance on the independent research  
For the purposes of the assessment, independent research means research carried out 
without the help or instruction of others, including teachers. 
The independent research must relate to the Gujarati-speaking cultural and/or social 
context. Students must base their research on all aspects of one of the prescribed research 
subjects listed on pages 8 and 9.  
The independent research must not relate to or make reference to one of the literary works 
or films studied for Paper 2. The independent research must: 
● allow students to gather evidence independently from at least two authentic sources in the 
assessed language. Authentic sources include newspaper and magazine articles, online 
written sources, journals, literary texts, films, television, radio, online audio-visual 
material and interviews. The types of evidence that show knowledge and understanding of 
society and culture (and research) are outlined in information relating to indicative content 
on page 16 
● enable students to contextualise and evaluate their findings independently. 
The table below gives guidance on the process that could be followed. 
 
Stage Description 
1 Pre-independent 
research 
● Teacher instruction on how to conduct research, for example 
teachers give advice on suitable resources and how to analyse 
information. 
● Initial conversations with teachers, explaining the content of the 
research subject as outlined in the specification. 
● Teachers should consider cultural sensitivities when giving 
guidance to students on selecting an appropriate research 
subject. 
● If students choose the research subject from Themes 1, 3 or 4, 
teachers should ensure that students focus their research on the 
Gujarat state only.  
● If students choose the research subject for Theme 2, teachers 
should ensure that students focus only on the Gujarat state 
and/or areas of India where Gujarati is spoken; they must not 
focus on other areas of India. 
2 Independent 
research 
● Students conduct research to find and select appropriate 
sources. 
● Teachers monitor the research by giving general feedback. 
● Students evaluate their findings and prepare for the assessment. 
 
It is recommended that students decide on their research subject as early as possible in the 
academic year. Learning hours for the independent research are not specified because the 
process of information collation and investigation is undertaken independently.

Teachers can: 
● give guidance on developing research skills (including methodology and analytical tools) 
● give guidance on the content of the research subjects as outlined in this specification 
● comment on the availability of resources and time constraints 
● advise on and direct students to the Assessment Objectives. 
 
Teachers must: 
● explain what ‘independence’ means (see definition in Guidance on the independent 
research on page 12) 
● confirm that the research meets all the aspects of the research subject and has the 
potential to meet the requirements of the assessment criteria  
● ensure that students do not intend to use any of the literary works or films they have 
studied for Paper 2 in their research 
● monitor the different research subjects being undertaken in a centre to ensure that 
independence is being maintained. If more than one student chooses the same research 
subject, the teacher must ensure that each student is working independently. 
 
Teachers must not: 
● teach the content of the research subjects to students and provide sources. 
Students must: 
● initiate and conduct their own research and develop their research skills when 
investigating their research subject. 
If malpractice is found to have taken place, a penalty may be applied, dependent on the 
circumstances and severity of the malpractice. 
For full details on malpractice, please see the section entitled Malpractice and the JCQ 
document Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and Assessments 2016–17. 
Synoptic assessment  
Synoptic assessment requires students to work across different areas of a qualification and 
to show their accumulated knowledge and understanding of a topic or subject area. 
Synoptic assessment enables students to show their ability to combine their skills, knowledge 
and understanding with breadth and depth of the subject.  
This paper assesses synopticity.

General guidance on using levels-based mark schemes 
Step 1: Decide on a marking band 
● First of all, the examiner will consider the answer as a whole and then decide which 
descriptors most closely match the answer and place it in that band. The descriptors for 
each band indicate the different features that will be seen in the student’s answer for that 
band. 
● When assigning a level, the examiner will look at the overall quality of the answer and not 
focus disproportionately on small and specific areas of the answer where the student has 
not performed quite as well as the rest. If the answer covers different aspects of different 
bands of the mark scheme, the examiner will use a ‘best fit’ approach for defining the 
level. They will then use the variability of the response to help decide the mark within the 
level. For example, if the response is predominantly band 13–16 with a small amount of 
band 17–20 material, it would be placed in band 13–16 but be awarded a mark near the 
top of the band because of the band 17–20 content. 
Step 2: Decide on a mark 
● Once the examiner has decided on a band, they will need to decide on a mark within the 
band. 
● They will decide on the mark to award based on the quality of the answer; they will award 
a mark towards the top or bottom of that band, depending on how the student has 
evidenced each of the descriptor bullet points. 
● The examiner will modify the mark based on how securely the trait descriptors are met at 
that band. 
● They will need to go back through the answer as they apply the mark scheme to clarify 
points and assure themselves that the band and the mark are appropriate.

Knowledge and understanding of society and culture  
(AO4 – 20 marks) 
This mark grid assesses the content of students’ answers in relation to the knowledge and 
understanding of culture and society they have demonstrated, based on their research. It 
also assesses their ability to critically analyse by sustaining a line of argument and drawing 
conclusions on aspects of culture and society, based on the question related to the research 
subject.  
Understand and respond to written language (AO2 – 10 marks) 
● This grid assesses students’ understanding of the unseen text through their ability to use 
relevant information from it to contribute to the ideas, arguments and conclusions 
presented on society and culture.  
● The two mark grids for AO4 and AO2 are presented side by side. This is because of the 
connection between the information that students are producing based on knowledge and 
understanding of society and culture, and the information that they are using from the 
unseen text to contribute to this.  
Indicative content 
● When deciding how to reward the answer for content, examiners will consult both of these 
mark grids as well as the indicative content associated with each question. This can be 
found in the document Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Gujarati (listening, 
reading and writing) Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs). Indicative content contains 
points that students are likely to use to construct their answer. It is possible for an answer 
to be constructed without mentioning some or all of these points, as long as students 
provide alternative responses that fulfil the requirements of the question. 
● The indicative content shows that students are expected to place more emphasis on 
knowledge and understanding of society and culture (AO4) than on the text (understand 
and respond in writing to written language – AO2). This emphasis is reflected in the 
greater number of marks available for AO4 (20 marks) than for AO2 (10 marks). 
● Students can demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of society and culture 
(research) by providing relevant ideas/information/references/examples related to aspects 
such as: 
o lifestyle/customs/events both current and historical  
o important figures both current and historical 
o public opinion, feelings, reactions and behaviour. 
 
This list is not exhaustive. These aspects are illustrated in the indicative content in the 
document Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Gujarati (listening, reading and writing)  
Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs). 
The recommended word count for the response is 300–350 words, but the whole response 
will be marked regardless of length.

Accuracy and range of language mark grid (AO3) 
This mark grid assesses students’ ability to use a range of grammatical structures and 
vocabulary accurately to produce articulate communication with a range of expression.  
 
Marks Description 
0 No rewardable language 
1–2 ● Limited variation of straightforward grammatical structures and vocabulary, 
with much repetition; repetitive expression, writing is often restricted and 
stilted. 
● Limited sequences of accurate language, resulting in lapses in coherence; 
errors occur that often prevent meaning being conveyed. 
3–4 ● Occasional variation in the use of mostly straightforward grammatical 
structures and vocabulary, infrequent use of complex language; expression is 
frequently repetitive, writing is sometimes stilted. 
● Some accurate sequences of language, resulting in some coherent writing; 
errors occur that sometimes hinder clarity of communication and occasionally 
prevent meaning being conveyed. 
5–6 ● Some variation in the use of grammatical structures and vocabulary, some 
recurrent examples of complex language; variation of expression but this is 
not sustained; sections of articulate writing with occasionally stilted phrasing. 
● Frequent sequences of accurate language, resulting in generally coherent 
writing; errors occur that occasionally hinder clarity of communication. 
7–8 ● Frequent variation in use of grammatical structures and vocabulary, including 
different types of complex language; regular variation of expression, writing is 
articulate throughout the majority of the response. 
● Accurate language throughout most of the response, resulting in mostly 
coherent writing; errors occur that rarely hinder clarity of communication. 
9–10 ● Consistent variation in use of grammatical structures and vocabulary, 
consistent variation in use of complex language; conveys ideas in a variety of 
ways, consistently articulate writing. 
● Accurate language throughout, resulting in consistently coherent writing; any 
errors do not hinder clarity of the communication. 
Additional guidance 
Complex language is considered to include the following: 
● conceptually challenging tenses such as the pluperfect, future perfect 
● passive voice 
● subjunctive mood 
● use of subordination 
● using extended sentences to express abstract ideas/convey justified arguments that 
require a range of lexis and structures, for example conjunctions and pronouns 
● using synonyms and a variety of expressions to say things in different ways.

Variation in use of grammatical structures/varied use of vocabulary: the traits in the 
mark grid differentiate between the variation of grammatical structures and vocabulary used 
by students. Examiners should judge in which mark band to place students and which mark 
to award based on the effect that the variety of grammatical structures and vocabulary has 
on the quality of the communication; the wider the variety, the more articulate the 
communication will become (see definition of articulate below).  
Examples of a variety of grammatical structures and vocabulary are: a selection of different 
verbs, tenses, adjectives, vocabulary (including to express literary and cinematic analysis, 
see further detail below), complex language (see definition below) for a variety of purposes, 
including to present and justify points of view, develop arguments and draw conclusions 
based on understanding. 
Articulate: articulate communication is fluent, effective and coherent as students  
control/manipulate the language to express themselves with ease for a number of different 
purposes. The more articulate the writing, the easier and more quickly the reader can 
progress through the writing without having to re-read to understand the message. If 
students are restricted to what they can express, they may not be able to use languages for 
all purposes, for example to justify arguments. The writing will become more difficult to read 
quickly and easily as the reader has to stop and re-read to understand the message.  
Errors: students are not expected to produce perfect, error-free writing in order to access 
the top band. The mark grid describes the frequency of errors and the impact that errors 
have on clarity. 
Errors that do not hinder clarity: 
• errors that do not affect meaning, for example some gender and adjectival agreements,  
as long as they do not include mismatch of cases 
વેગવંતો ઘોડ�.  
બટકબોલી છોકરો.  
• infrequent errors that do not distract the reader from the content and which result in 
coherent writing. 
Errors that hinder clarity: 
● errors that make writing difficult to understand immediately (even if the meaning is 
eventually understood)/errors that force readers to re-read in order to understand what is 
meant, for example inappropriate tense formation, wrong case endings 
મહ�શ ગયા અઠવા�ડયે �ુકાનમાં જઈને ખર�દ� કર� છે.  
આવતાં છ મ�હનામાં આ શહ�રનો િવકાસ ન થયો.  
● frequent errors that hinder clarity as they will distract the reader from the content of the 
writing. 
Errors that prevent meaning being conveyed: 
● errors that mean the reader cannot understand the message 
● errors that convey the wrong message  
● errors that make it unclear who is carrying out the action, i.e. using the incorrect person 
of the verb 
તેના િપતાઓએ બધાને �ુસ્સો કય�.  
દાન આપણે ભેગા કય�.  
● mother-tongue interference.

Paper 2: Translation into Gujarati and written 
response to works  
Content 
Students should be able to: 
● manipulate language accurately through translating an unseen passage from English  
into Gujarati 
● develop a detailed understanding and appreciation of the works studied, by writing critical 
and analytical responses in the language of study to the works, taken from the prescribed 
list provided (see Appendix 1: Prescribed literary texts and films) 
● produce responses that relate to features such as the form and the technique of 
presentation; key themes, concepts and issues; characterisation; structure of the plot and 
the social and cultural setting 
● present viewpoints, develop arguments, persuade, analyse and evaluate. 
Although speaking skills are not directly assessed in the qualification, students should be 
encouraged to develop their speaking skills in Gujarati during the course of study. 
Translation into Gujarati 
The content of the translation will be taken from any one of the sub-themes in the  
four themes. 
Written response to works 
Students must study two discrete Gujarati works: either two literary texts or one literary text 
and one film. The works must be taken from the list in Appendix 1: Prescribed literary texts 
and films. The literary texts listed include a novel, short stories and essays. All films are  
feature length.

and Section C (written response to works). 
● For Section A (translation into Gujarati), 30 minutes (recommended timing), 20 marks: 
o students are given one unseen text in English and must translate it into Gujarati. 
● For Sections B and C (written response to works), 2 hours and 10 minutes, 90 marks: 
o students must write two essays selected from Section B (literary texts) or one selected 
from Section B (literary texts) and one from Section C (films) 
o there will be a choice of two questions for each literary text and film. As a guide, we 
advise students to write approximately 300–350 words for each essay in order to give a 
detailed analysis of the works, although the whole essay will be marked regardless of 
length 
o students should justify points of view, arguments and conclusions with evidence from 
the work  
o students are expected to provide a critical and analytical response by selecting relevant 
material from the works, presenting and justifying points of view, developing 
arguments, drawing conclusions based on understanding and evaluating different 
aspects of the works studied 
o no credit will be given for essays on literary texts that are based on film versions 
adapted from the literary texts. Evidence given in the essay to justify viewpoints and 
arguments must be based on the original literary text. 
● All questions will be set in Gujarati and must be answered in Gujarati. 
● The use of dictionaries is not permitted. 
● Students must not take any documentation relating to the works into the examination. 
The recommended timings have been given to enable students to complete each section in 
sufficient time. 
Sample assessment materials 
A sample paper and marking criteria (including guidance on how these criteria are applied) 
for this paper can be found in the Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Gujarati 
(listening, reading and writing) Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) document. 
Marking guidance 
Marking guidance has been written to accompany the SAMs and is included with the SAMs 
booklet. Please note that this guidance is for the use of the Pearson-appointed external 
examiners. It has been included in this specification for reference to help teachers 
understand how the assessment criteria will be applied.

Marking guidance for Paper 2: Translation into Gujarati and 
written response to works  
This marking guidance is for the use of Pearson-appointed external examiners. It has been 
included in this specification for reference to help teachers understand how the assessment 
criteria will be applied. 
Section A – Question 1 (translation into Gujarati) 
This question is marked using a points-based mark scheme in which 1 mark is given for each 
correct individual section of language. Please see the Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE 
in Gujarati (listening, reading and writing) Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) document 
for an example of how the translation will be marked. 
Sections B and C – Questions 2 to 7 (written response to works) 
There are three levels-based mark grids to be applied to each individual essay included in 
Sections B and C, written response to works. The mark grids are: 
● critical and analytical response (AO4) 
● range of grammatical structures and vocabulary (AO3) 
● accuracy of language (AO3). 
General guidance on using levels-based mark schemes 
Step 1: Decide on a marking band 
● First of all, the examiner will consider the answer as a whole and then decide which 
descriptors most closely match the answer and place it in that band. The descriptors for 
each band indicate the different features that will be seen in the student’s answer for that 
band. 
● When assigning a level, the examiner will look at the overall quality of the answer and not 
focus disproportionately on small and specific areas of the answer where the student has 
not performed quite as well as the rest. If the answer covers different aspects of different 
bands of the mark scheme, the examiner will use a ‘best fit’ approach for defining the 
level. They will then use the variability of the response to help decide the mark within the 
level. For example, if the response is predominantly band 5–8 with a small amount of 
band 9–12 material, it would be placed in band 5–8 but be awarded a mark near the top 
of the band because of the band 9–12 content. 
Step 2: Decide on a mark 
● Once the examiner has decided on a band they will need to decide on a mark within the 
band. 
● They will decide on the mark to award based on the quality of the answer; they will award 
a mark towards the top or bottom of that band, depending on how the student has 
evidenced each of the descriptor bullet points. 
● The examiner will modify the mark based on how securely the trait descriptors are met at 
that band. 
● They will need to go back through the answer as they apply the mark scheme to clarify 
points and assure themselves that the band and the mark are appropriate.

Sections B and C – Questions 2 to 7 (written response to works) 
Critical and analytical response (AO4) 
● This mark grid assesses students’ ability to respond critically and analytically to the aspect 
of the literary text or film outlined in the question. To provide a critical and analytical 
response, students should select relevant material, present and justify points of view, 
develop arguments, draw conclusions based on understanding and evaluate issues, 
themes and cultural and social contexts. 
● This grid should be applied twice, once for each essay individually. 
● When deciding how to reward an answer, examiners will consult this mark grid as well as 
the indicative content associated with each question, which can be found in the document 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Gujarati (listening, reading and writing) Sample 
Assessment Materials (SAMs). Indicative content contains points that students are likely to 
use to construct their answer. It is possible for an answer to be constructed without 
mentioning some or all of these points, as long as students provide alternative responses 
that fulfil the requirements of the question.  
● The recommended word count for each essay is 300–350 words, but the whole essay will 
be marked regardless of length. 
 
Marks Description 
0 No rewardable material. 
1–4 ● Points of view relating to issues/themes/cultural or social contexts are presented 
with simplistic justification or limited interpretation with frequent 
misunderstanding or confusion; any evidence from the work is descriptive. 
● Limited ability to form arguments or draw conclusions. 
● Response relates to the work but limited focus on the question. 
5–8 ● Response relates to the work but often loses focus on the question. 
● Points of view relating to issues/themes/cultural or social contexts are presented, 
with attempts made at interpretation, but they occasionally show 
misunderstanding or confusion; evidence selected from the work for justification 
is occasionally appropriate but often descriptive. 
● Arguments are made but with inconsistencies; conclusions are drawn but do not 
fully link to arguments. 
9–12 ● Critical analysis of issues/themes/cultural or social contexts is evident in relation 
to particular aspects of the question, with some appropriate interpretations and 
points of view, sometimes justified by appropriately selected evidence from  
the work. 
● Logical arguments are followed through on particular aspects of the question, 
occasionally detailed and with linked conclusions; some points are made  
without exploration. 
● Response is relevant to particular aspects of the question, occasional loss  
of focus. 
13–16 ● Critical analysis of issues/themes/cultural or social contexts is frequently 
demonstrated, with some convincing interpretations and points of view, 
predominantly justified with appropriately selected evidence from the work. 
● Generally detailed, logical arguments are made, with some persuasive 
conclusions that mostly link together. 
● Predominantly relevant response to the question.

Articulate: articulate communication is fluent, effective and coherent as students  
control/manipulate the language to say what they want to say rather than what they can 
say, for a number of different purposes. If students are restricted to what they can say, they 
may not be able to express themselves for all purposes, for example to develop arguments. 
Terminology for literary and cinematic analysis: vocabulary for critical analysis 
according to the work being studied, for example ‘plot’, ‘character’; figures of speech such as 
‘metaphor’, ‘similes’; to describe theme and style such as ‘camera technique’, ‘hand-held 
camera’, ‘use of black and white’, ‘first person narrative’. 
Complex language is considered to include the following: 
● conceptually challenging tenses such as the pluperfect and future perfect 
● passive voice 
● subjunctive mood 
● use of subordination 
● using extended sentences to express abstract ideas/convey justified arguments that 
require a range of lexis and structures, for example conjunctions and pronouns 
● using synonyms and a variety of expressions to say things in different ways 
Straightforward language is considered to be: 
● simple sentences with limited linking of sentences and clauses 
● high-frequency grammatical structures and vocabulary.

Paper 3: Listening, reading and writing in Gujarati 
Content 
Students will be assessed on their understanding of spoken Gujarati from a variety of 
authentic listening sources, as well as on their ability to summarise and evaluate viewpoints 
in spoken and written material. 
Recordings vary in length and include an extended passage. All spoken and written materials 
are culturally relevant to the Gujarat state and areas of India where Gujarati is spoken and 
for Section A are drawn from across the four themes (listed on pages 8–9). Materials for 
Section B will be drawn from any one of the sub-themes from the four themes. 
Students should be able to: 
● listen, and respond in writing, to spoken passages, including an extended passage from a 
range of different contexts and sources, understand main points, gist and detail from 
spoken and written material 
● infer meaning from complex spoken material 
● assimilate and use information from spoken and written sources  
● summarise information from spoken and written sources, reporting key points and subject 
matter in writing 
● identify main ideas, and summarise different points of view, drawn from spoken and 
written sources 
● evaluate points of view and draw conclusions in writing 
● apply listening, reading and writing skills in combination. 
Although speaking skills are not directly assessed in the qualification, students should be 
encouraged to develop their speaking skills in Gujarati during their course of study.  
Section A (listening comprehension) 
The listening section will be made up of spoken passages covering different registers and 
types, including authentic communication involving one or more male and female speakers. 
Sources will include material from online media. 
Section B (listening, reading and writing question) 
This section comprises a listening source and a reading text. Students must summarise the 
different points of view in each source. They must then answer a question that requires them 
to evaluate the viewpoints in both sources and draw conclusions.

one in sufficient time to access the full range of assessment criteria. 
Synoptic assessment 
Synoptic assessment requires students to work across different areas of a qualification and 
to show their accumulated knowledge and understanding of a topic or subject area. 
Synoptic assessment enables students to show their ability to combine their skills, knowledge 
and understanding with breadth and depth of the subject.  
This paper assesses synopticity. 
Sample assessment materials 
A sample paper and marking criteria (including guidance on how these criteria are applied) 
for this paper can be found in the Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Gujarati 
(listening, reading and writing) Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) document.

Marking guidance for Paper 3: Listening, reading and writing 
in Gujarati 
Marking guidance has been written to accompany the SAMs and is included with the SAMs 
booklet. Please note that this guidance is for the use of the Pearson-appointed external 
examiners. It is printed for reference in the specification to aid understanding of how the 
assessment criteria will be applied. 
Section A – Questions 1 to 4 
A points-based mark scheme for this section can be found in the Pearson Edexcel Level 3 
Advanced GCE in Gujarati (listening, reading and writing) Sample Assessment Materials 
(SAMs) document. 
Section B – Listening, reading and writing  
A points-based mark scheme for Questions 5(a) and 5(b) can be found in the Pearson 
Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Gujarati (listening, reading and writing) Sample 
Assessment Materials (SAMs) document. 
There are three levels-based mark grids applied to Question 5(c). The mark grids are: 
● understand and respond to spoken language (AO1) 
● understand and respond to spoken/written language (AO2) 
● accuracy and range of language (AO3). 
General guidance on using levels-based mark schemes 
Step 1: Decide on a marking band 
● First of all, the examiner will consider the answer as a whole and then decide which 
descriptors most closely match the answer and place it in that band. The descriptors for 
each band indicate the different features that will be seen in the student’s answer for  
that band. 
● When assigning a band, the examiner will look at the overall quality of the answer and not 
focus disproportionately on small and specific areas of the answer where the student has 
not performed quite as well as the rest or indeed has performed temporarily better. If the 
answer covers different aspects of different bands of the mark scheme, they will use a 
‘best fit’ approach for defining the band. They will then use the variability of the response 
to help decide the mark within the band. For example, if the response is predominantly 
band 3–4 with a small amount of band 5–6 material, it would be placed in band 3–4 but 
be awarded a mark at the top of the band because of the band 5–6 content. 
Step 2: Decide on a mark 
● Once the examiner has decided on a band, they will then need to decide on a mark within  
the band. 
● The examiner will decide the mark to award based on the quality of the answer; they will 
award a mark towards the top or bottom of that band depending on how the student has 
evidenced each of the descriptor bullet points. 
● The examiner will modify the mark based on how securely the trait descriptors are met at 
that band. 
● The examiner will need to go back through the answer as they apply the mark scheme to 
clarify points and to assure that the band and the mark are appropriate.

Understand and respond to spoken language (AO1 – 6 marks) 
This mark grid assesses students’ understanding of spoken language and how well they use 
information from it to evaluate and draw conclusions. 
Understand and respond to written language (AO2 – 6 marks) 
● This mark grid assesses students’ understanding of written language and how well they 
use information from it to evaluate and draw conclusions. 
● The two mark grids for AO1 and AO2 are presented side by side. This is because of the 
interconnection of the task in that students need to compare information that they hear to 
the information that they read. They need to do this in order to weigh up the views in both 
sources, to be able to write their evaluation and come to cohesive conclusions. 
Indicative content 
● When deciding how to reward an answer, examiners will consult this mark grid as well as 
the indicative content associated with the question, which can be found in the Pearson 
Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Gujarati (listening, reading and writing) Sample 
Assessment Materials (SAMs) document. Indicative content contains points that students 
are likely to use to construct their answer. It is possible for an answer to be constructed 
without mentioning some or all of these points, as long as students provide alternative 
responses that fulfil the requirements of the question.  
● The recommended word count for Question 5(c) is 200–250 words, but the whole 
response will be marked regardless of length.

Accuracy and range of language mark grid (AO3) 
This mark grid assesses students’ ability to use a range of grammatical structures and 
vocabulary accurately to produce articulate communication with a range of expression.  
 
Marks Description 
0 No rewardable language 
1–2 ● Limited variation of straightforward grammatical structures and vocabulary 
with much repetition; repetitive expression, writing is often restricted  
and stilted. 
● Limited sequences of accurate language, resulting in lapses in coherence; 
errors occur that often prevent meaning being conveyed. 
3–4 ● Occasional variation in the use of mostly straightforward grammatical 
structures and vocabulary, infrequent use of complex language; expression is 
frequently repetitive, writing is sometimes stilted. 
● Some accurate sequences of language, resulting in some coherent writing; 
errors occur that sometimes hinder clarity of communication and occasionally 
prevent meaning being conveyed 
5–6 ● Some variation in the use of grammatical structures and vocabulary, some 
recurrent examples of complex language; variation of expression but this is 
not sustained; sections of articulate writing with occasionally stilted phrasing. 
● Frequent sequences of accurate language, resulting in generally coherent 
writing; errors occur that occasionally hinder clarity of communication. 
7–8 ● Frequent variation in use of grammatical structures and vocabulary, including 
different types of complex language; regular variation of expression, writing is 
articulate throughout the majority of the response. 
● Accurate language throughout most of the response, resulting in mostly 
coherent writing; errors occur that rarely hinder clarity of communication. 
9–10 ● Consistent variation in use of grammatical structures and vocabulary, 
consistent variation in use of complex language; conveys ideas in a variety of 
ways, consistently articulate writing. 
● Accurate language throughout, resulting in consistently coherent writing; any 
errors do not hinder clarity of the communication 
Additional guidance 
Complex language is considered to include the following: 
● conceptually challenging tenses such as the pluperfect and future perfect 
● passive voice 
● subjunctive mood 
● use of subordination 
● using extended sentences to express abstract ideas/convey justified arguments that 
require a range of lexis and structures, for example conjunctions and pronouns 
● using synonyms and a variety of expressions to say things in different ways.

Variation in use of grammatical structures/varied use of vocabulary: the traits in the 
mark grid differentiate between the variation of grammatical structures and vocabulary used 
by students. Examiners should judge in which mark band to place students and which mark 
to award, based on the effect that the variety of grammatical structures and vocabulary has 
on the quality of the communication; the wider the variety, the more articulate the 
communication will become, (see definition of articulate below).  
Examples of a variety of grammatical structures and vocabulary are: a selection of different 
verbs, tenses, adjectives, vocabulary (including to express literary and cinematic analysis, 
see further detail below), complex language (see definition below) for a variety of purposes, 
including to present and justify points of view, develop arguments, draw conclusions based 
on understanding and evaluating issues. 
Articulate: articulate communication is fluent, effective and coherent as students  
control/manipulate the language to express themselves with ease for a number of different 
purposes. The more articulate the writing, the easier the reader can progress through the 
writing without having to re-read to understand the message. If students are restricted to 
what they can express, they may not be able to use languages for all purposes, for example 
to justify arguments/interest the reader. The writing will become more difficult to read with 
ease as the reader has to stop and re-read to understand the message.  
Errors: students are not expected to produce perfect, error-free writing in order to access 
the top band. The mark grid describes the frequency of errors and the impact that errors 
have on clarity. 
Errors that do not hinder clarity: 
● errors that do not affect meaning, for example some gender and adjectival agreements,  
as long as they do not include mismatch of cases 
વેગવંતો ઘોડ�.  
બટકબોલી છોકરો.  
● infrequent errors that do not distract the reader from the content and which result in 
coherent writing. 
Errors that hinder clarity: 
● errors that make writing difficult to understand immediately (even if the meaning is 
eventually understood)/errors that force readers to re-read in order to understand what is 
meant, for example inappropriate tense formation, wrong case endings 
મહ�શ ગયા અઠવા�ડયે �ુકાનમાં જઈને ખર�દ� કર� છે.  
આવતાં છ મ�હનામાં આ શહ�રનો િવકાસ ન થયો.  
● frequent errors that hinder clarity as they will distract the reader from the content of the 
writing. 
Errors that prevent meaning being conveyed: 
● errors that mean the reader cannot understand the message 
● errors that convey the wrong message  
● errors that make it unclear who is carrying out the action, i.e. using the incorrect person 
of the verb 
તેના િપતાઓએ બધાને �ુસ્સો કય�.  
દાન આપણે ભેગા કય�.  
● mother-tongue interference.

3 Administration and general information 
Entries 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our UK Information Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers and is 
available on our website. 
Discount code and performance tables 
Centres should be aware that students who enter for more than one GCE qualification with 
the same discount code will have only one of the grades they achieve counted for the 
purpose of the school and college performance tables. 
Students should be advised that if they take two GCE qualifications with the same discount 
code, the colleges, universities and employers to which they wish to progress are likely to 
take the view that this achievement is equivalent to only one GCE. The same view may be 
taken if students take two GCE qualifications that have different discount codes but which 
have significant overlap of content. Before embarking on their programmes, students or their 
advisers who have any doubts about their subject combinations should check with the 
institution to which they wish to progress. 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, 
special consideration and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our Equality Policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
● students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
● all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
The language of assessment for this qualification is Gujarati. All student work must be in 
Gujarati, except the translation in Paper 1 (Section A), which requires a response in English. 
Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to: 
● access the assessment 
● show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment. 
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability, without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under the 
Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
  
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Gujarati (listening, reading and writing) 
 – Specification – Issue 1 – May 2018  © Pearson Education Limited 2018 
40 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment. 
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable adjustments 
where a person with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in undertaking an 
assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps to overcome 
that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular person may be unique to that individual and, 
therefore, might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
including: 
● the needs of the student with the disability 
● the effectiveness of the adjustment 
● the cost of the adjustment; and 
● the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation, or affects timeframes or the security or integrity of the assessment. This is 
because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a student's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the 
examination/assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material 
effect on a student’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate their level of attainment in 
an assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements 
and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
consideration, please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk 
Malpractice 
Student malpractice 
Student malpractice refers to any act by a student that compromises or seeks to compromise 
the process of assessment or which undermines the integrity of the qualifications or the 
validity of results/certificates. 
Student malpractice in examinations must be reported to Pearson using a JCQ Form M1 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to Investigations Team, Pearson, 190 High Holborn, 
London, WC1V 7BH. Please provide as much information and supporting documentation as 
possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice.

41 
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with student malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the 
integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on a JCQ Form 
M2a (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form, supporting 
documentation and as much information as possible can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to Investigations Team, Pearson, 190 High Holborn, 
London, WC1V 7BH. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies with 
Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
General and Vocational Qualifications Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and 
Assessments Policies and Procedures, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice. 
Awarding and reporting

Student recruitment and progression 
Pearson follows the JCQ policy concerning recruitment to our qualifications in that: 
• they must be available to anyone who is capable of reaching the required standard 
• they must be free from barriers that restrict access and progression 
• equal opportunities exist for all students. 
Prior learning and other requirements 
There are no prior learning or other requirements for this qualification. 
Students who would benefit most from studying this qualification are likely to have a Level 2 
qualification such as a GCSE in Gujarati. However, students do not need to have studied a 
GCSE in Gujarati to follow this course. 
Progression 
This qualification offers a suitable progression route from GCSE, focusing on the 
development of three language skills: listening, reading and writing. Grammar and the 
mastering of linguistic features are key elements of this qualification, as is the inclusion of 
authentic written and spoken sources, responding through writing to literature and film, and 
independent research. 
Students are expected to be able to develop knowledge and understanding of society past 
and present, and of the political and artistic culture of the Gujarat state and other areas of 
India where Gujarati is spoken. They should be able to express and justify their own 
opinions, develop arguments and persuade in writing, building on the fluency developed at 
Key Stage 4.  
The skill of translation will be developed from those skills practised at Key Stages 3 and 4.  
The range of topics promotes a clear progression in grammar, vocabulary and cultural 
knowledge and understanding from Key Stage 4 and will increase linguistic and cognitive 
demand. The grammar list illustrates the level required for this qualification.  
This qualification offers a suitable progression route to further study at university level.  
In addition, the study of one language at GCE can facilitate and help promote the learning of 
other languages. The qualification may also add to an individual’s employability profile, 
particularly for UK organisations trading overseas as well as with international companies 
based in the UK and globally. Students can progress to a wide range of careers in areas such 
as journalism and media, education, science, medicine, the civil service, sales, marketing, 
retail, and charities. 
Students will be able to apply their knowledge, skills and understanding to authentic, real-life 
contexts. They will develop transferable skills that support the study of other GCE subjects, 
higher-education study and the transition to employment, together with an understanding 
and appreciation of the Gujarat state and other areas of India where Gujarati is spoken.

Students at A Level are expected to have studied the grammatical system and structures of 
the language during their course. Knowledge of the grammar and structures specified for 
GCSE is assumed. 
In the examination, students will be required to use, actively and accurately, grammar and 
structures appropriate to the tasks set, drawn from the following lists. The mention of an 
item in the lists implies knowledge of both its forms and its functions at an appropriate level 
of accuracy and complexity. 
The examples in italics in parentheses are indicative, that is they serve to illustrate the part 
of speech or structure that students must know and hence do not represent an exhaustive 
specification of the required grammatical knowledge.

Appendix 3: The context for the 
development of this qualification 
All our qualifications are designed to meet our World Class Qualification Principles[1] and our 
ambition to put the student at the heart of everything we do. 
We have developed and designed this qualification by: 
● reviewing other curricula and qualifications to ensure that it is comparable with those 
taken in high-performing jurisdictions overseas 
● consulting with key stakeholders on content and assessment, including higher-education 
academics and teachers to ensure this qualification is suitable for a UK context 
● reviewing the legacy qualification and building on its positive attributes. 
This qualification has also been developed to meet criteria stipulated by Ofqual in their 
documents GCE Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements and GCSE/GCE Subject 
Level Conditions and Requirements for Modern Foreign Languages, published in April 2016. 
  
                                                
[1] Pearson’s World Class Qualification Principles ensure that our qualifications are: 
● demanding, through internationally benchmarked standards, encouraging deep learning and 
measuring higher-order skills 
● rigorous, through setting and maintaining standards over time, developing reliable and valid 
assessment tasks and processes, and generating confidence in end users of the knowledge, skills 
and competencies of certified students 
● inclusive, through conceptualising learning as continuous, recognising that students develop at 
different rates and have different learning needs, and focusing on progression 
● empowering, through promoting the development of transferable skills, see Appendix 4.

From Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class Qualifications 
May 2014 
“The reform of the qualifications system in England is a profoundly important change to the 
education system. need to know that the Teachers new qualifications will assist them in 
helping their learners make progress in their lives. 
When these changes were first proposed, we were approached by Pearson to join an ‘Expert 
Panel’ that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. 
We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of 
our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe. 
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification development 
process that has included: 
● establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications 
● subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual 
accreditation criteria in advance of submission.  
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented. The 
design has been guided by what is called an ‘Efficacy Framework’, meaning learner outcomes 
have been at the heart of this development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s 
success in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have 
supported the development of qualifications that are outstanding for their coherence, 
thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as representing world-class best 
practice.”

Appendix 4: Transferable skills 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher-education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned and 
that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and can be 
built upon and extended through learning.’[1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework as the most evidence-based and 
robust skills framework. We adapted the framework slightly to include the Program for 
International Student Assessment (PISA) ICT Literacy and Collaborative Problem Solving 
(CPS) Skills. 
The adapted National Research Council’s framework of skills involves the following[2]. 
Cognitive skills 
● Non-routine problem solving – expert thinking, metacognition, creativity. 
● Systems thinking – decision making and reasoning. 
● Critical thinking – definitions of critical thinking are broad and usually involve general 
cognitive skills such as analysing, synthesising and reasoning skills. 
● ICT literacy – access, manage, integrate, evaluate, construct and communicate[3]. 
Interpersonal skills 
● Communication – active listening, speaking communication, written communication, 
assertive communication and non-verbal communication. 
● Relationship-building skills – teamwork, trust, intercultural sensitivity, service 
orientation, self-presentation, social influence, conflict resolution and negotiation. 
● Collaborative problem solving – establishing and maintaining shared understanding, 
taking appropriate action, establishing and maintaining team organisation. 
Intrapersonal skills 
● Adaptability – ability and willingness to cope with the uncertain, handling work stress, 
adapting to different personalities, communication styles and cultures, and physical 
adaptability to various indoor and outdoor work environments. 
● Self-management and self-development – ability to work remotely in virtual teams, 
work autonomously, be self-motivating and self-monitoring, willing and able to acquire 
new information and skills related to work. 
Transferable skills enable young people to face the demands of further and higher education, 
as well as the demands of the workplace, and are important in the teaching and learning of 
this qualification. We will provide teaching and learning materials, developed with 
stakeholders, to support our qualifications.

Appendix 5: Level 3 Extended Project 
qualification 
What is the Extended Project? 
The Extended Project is a standalone qualification that can be taken alongside GCEs. It 
supports the development of independent learning skills and helps to prepare students for 
their next step – whether that be higher education or employment. The qualification: 
● is recognised by higher education for the skills it develops 
● is worth half of an Advanced GCE qualification at grades A*–E 
● carries UCAS points for university entry. 
The Extended Project encourages students to develop skills in the following areas: research, 
critical thinking, extended writing and project management. Students identify and agree a 
topic area of their choice for in-depth study (which may or may not be related to a GCE 
subject they are already studying), guided by their teacher. 
Students can choose from one of four approaches to produce: 
● a dissertation (for example an investigation based on predominantly secondary research) 
● an investigation/field study (for example a practical experiment) 
● a performance (for example in music, drama or sport) 
● an artefact (for example creating a sculpture in response to a client brief or solving an 
engineering problem). 
The qualification is coursework based and students are assessed, in English, on the skills of 
managing, planning and evaluating their project. Students will research their topic, develop 
skills to review and evaluate the information, and then present the final outcome of their 
project. 
The Extended Project has 120 guided learning hours (GLH) consisting of a 40-GLH taught 
element that includes teaching the technical skills (for example research skills) and an 80-
GLH guided element that includes mentoring students through the project work. The 
qualification is 100% internally assessed and externally moderated. 
How to link the Extended Project with languages 
The Extended Project creates the opportunity to develop transferable skills for progression to 
higher education and to the workplace, through the exploration of either an area of personal 
interest or a topic of interest from within the language qualification content. The project 
must be written in English. 
Through the Extended Project, students will develop skills that support their study of 
Gujarati, including: 
● conducting, organising and using research 
● independent reading in the subject area 
● planning, project management and time management 
● defining a hypothesis to be tested in investigations or developing a design brief 
● collecting, handling and interpreting data and evidence 
● evaluating arguments and processes, including arguments in favour of alternative 
interpretations of data and evaluation of experimental methodology 
● critical thinking.

Specification – Issue 1 – May 2018  © Pearson Education Limited 2018 
55 
In the context of the Extended Project, critical thinking refers to the ability to identify and 
develop arguments for a point of view or hypothesis and to consider and respond to 
alternative arguments. This supports the development of evaluative skills, through 
evaluating different arguments, and using qualitative and quantitative evidence to support 
informed judgements and propose evidence-based solutions to issues. 
Types of Extended Project related to languages 
Students may produce a dissertation on any topic that can be researched and debated, for 
example a controversial issue such as ‘equal rights for all’, ‘the role of the church’ or 
‘hooliganism in sport ’. 
A dissertation might involve an investigation such as: 
● the impact of English language on the Gujarati music industry 
● the success of different types of schools in Gujarat. 
The dissertation uses secondary research sources to provide a reasoned defence or a point of 
view, with consideration of counter-arguments. 
An alternative might be an investigative project or field study involving the collection of data 
from primary research, for example: 
● the impact of western arts and culture on Gujarati society 
● a statistical survey of changing attitudes towards technology among young people in 
Gujarat. 
A field study might consider an issue that lends itself to primary research, for example an 
investigation into the impact of government subsidies on the Gujarati film and music 
industry. 
Using the Extended Project to support breadth and depth 
In the Extended Project, students are assessed on the quality of the work they produce and 
the skills they develop and demonstrate through completing this work. Students should 
demonstrate that they have extended themselves in some significant way beyond what they 
have been studying in Gujarati. Students can demonstrate extension in one or more 
dimensions: 
● deepening understanding – where a student explores a topic in greater depth than in 
the specification content. This could be an in-depth exploration of one aspect of the 
themes 
● broadening skills – where a student learns a new skill. This might be learning how to 
design a website or learning a new statistical technique that can be used in the analysis of 
either primary or secondary data collected by the student 
● widening perspectives – where the student’s project spans different subjects. A student 
studying Gujarati with business may wish to research the impact of tourism on a particular 
region or locality. A student studying Gujarati with history may wish to analyse the impact 
of the Mughal Empire on today’s society. 
Information to support the delivery and assessment of the Extended Project, including this 
specification, can be found on our website.
