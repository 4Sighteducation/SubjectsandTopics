From Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class Qualifications 
 
“ The reform of the qualifications system in England is a profoundly important 
change to the education system. Teachers need to know that the new qualifications 
will assist them in helping their learners make progress in their lives. 
When these changes were first proposed we were approached by Pearson to join an 
‘Expert Panel’ that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. 
We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or 
because of our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the 
world as diverse as Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries 
across Europe. 
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification 
development process that has included: 
● extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-
performing jurisdictions in the world 
● benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they 
are at the right level of demand 
● establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-
specific expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications 
● subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual 
accreditation criteria in advance of submission.  
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future 
oriented. The design has been guided by what is called an ‘Efficacy Framework’, 
meaning learner outcomes have been at the heart of this development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a 
learner’s success in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident 
that we have supported the development of qualifications that are outstanding for 
their coherence, thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as 
representing world-class best practice.

Introduction 
The Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in English Language and Literature is 
designed for use in schools and colleges. It is part of a suite of GCE qualifications 
offered by Pearson. 
Purpose of the specification 
This specification sets out: 
● the objectives of the qualification 
● any other qualification(s) that a student must have completed before taking the 
qualification 
● any prior knowledge and skills that the student is required to have before taking 
the qualification 
● any other requirements that a student must have satisfied before they will be 
assessed or before the qualification will be awarded 
● the knowledge and understanding that will be assessed as part of the 
qualification 
● the method of assessment and any associated requirements relating to it 
● the criteria against which a student’s level of attainment will be measured (such 
as assessment criteria). 
 
 
Rationale 
The Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in English Language and Literature 
meets the following purposes, which fulfil those defined by the Office of 
Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) for GCE qualifications in their 
GCE Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements document, published in  
April 2014. 
The purposes of this qualification are to: 
● define and assess achievement of the knowledge, skills and understanding that 
will be needed by students planning to progress to undergraduate study at a UK 
higher education establishment, particularly (although not only) in the same 
subject area, English, English Literature and English Language 
● set out a robust and internationally comparable post-16 academic course of 
study to develop that knowledge, skills and understanding 
● enable UK universities to accurately identify the level of attainment of students 
● provide a basis for school and college accountability measures at age 18 
● provide a benchmark of academic ability for employers. 
Qualification aims and objectives 
The aims and objectives of the Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in English 
Language and Literature are to enable students to: 
● develop and apply their knowledge of literary analysis and evaluation 
● develop and apply their understanding of the concepts and methods appropriate 
for the analysis and study of language 
● use linguistic and literary approaches in their reading and interpretation of 
texts, showing how the two disciplines can relate to each other 
● engage creatively and critically with a wide range of texts 
● explore the ways in which texts relate to each other and the contexts in which 
they are produced and received 
● develop their skills as producers and interpreters of language 
● undertake independent and sustained studies to develop their skills as 
producers and interpreters of language. 
 
 
The context for the development of this qualification 
All our qualifications are designed to meet our World Class Qualification Principles[1] 
and our ambition to put the student at the heart of everything we do. 
We have developed and designed this qualification by: 
● reviewing other curricula and qualifications to ensure that it is comparable with 
those taken in high-performing jurisdictions overseas 
● consulting with key stakeholders on content and assessment, including learned 
bodies, subject associations, higher-education academics, teachers and 
employers to ensure this qualification is suitable for a UK context 
● reviewing the legacy qualification and building on its positive attributes. 
This qualification has also been developed to meet criteria stipulated by Ofqual in 
their documents GCE Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements and GCE 
Subject Level Conditions and Requirements for English Language and Literature, 
published in April 2014. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[1] Pearson’s World Class Qualification principles ensure that our qualifications are: 
● demanding, through internationally benchmarked standards, encouraging deep 
learning and measuring higher-order skills 
● rigorous, through setting and maintaining standards over time, developing 
reliable and valid assessment tasks and processes, and generating confidence  
in end users of the knowledge, skills and competencies of certified students 
● inclusive, through conceptualising learning as continuous, recognising that 
students develop at different rates and have different learning needs, and 
focusing on progression 
● empowering, through promoting the development of transferable skills,

● apply relevant methods for text analysis, drawing on linguistic and literary fields  
● apply varied strategies for reading and listening according to text type and 
purpose for study  
● identify and describe how meanings and effects are created and conveyed in 
texts  
● show knowledge and understanding of the ways in which texts relate to the 
contexts in which they are produced and received 
● apply linguistic and literary methodologies and concepts to inform their 
responses to and interpretations of texts  
● explore connections across a wide range of literary and non-literary texts  
● use English appropriately, accurately and creatively  
● use a range of techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of texts for different 
audiences and purposes, informed by wide reading and listening  
● show awareness of the different language levels, as appropriate, drawn from: 
phonetics, phonology and prosodics, lexis and semantics, grammar and 
morphology, pragmatics, and discourse 
● make accurate reference to texts and sources

Anthology 
Students will study a wide range of non-literary and digital texts from the  
20th- and 21st centuries.  
Teaching will be supported by Voices in Speech and Writing: An Anthology provided 
by Pearson free of charge. The anthology has been designed to introduce students 
to the ways in which ‘voices’ are used or crafted in a variety of non-literary and 
digital genres, encouraging the analysis of linguistic and literary features and 
generic conventions in a range of non-literary and digital forms. 
The anthology contains a variety of non-literary and digital texts from different 
forms, such as interviews, broadcasts, podcasts, blogs, screenplays and 
travelogues. This anthology constitutes a non-literary set text for this qualification 
and will be assessed in Section A of the examination.  
Drama 
Students will also study one literary drama text from the prescribed list below, 
giving them the opportunity to study how writers create different voices within a 
literary genre. The drama text will be assessed in Section B of the examination.  
Students will study a choice of one drama text from the following: 
All My Sons, Arthur Miller 
A Streetcar Named Desire, Tennessee Williams 
Elmina’s Kitchen, Kwame Kwei-Armah 
Equus, Peter Shaffer

thoughts or ideas on a theme in literary and non-fiction writing. Students will 
develop their understanding of how writers use language techniques and literary 
devices to craft their work and communicate ideas or issues, making connections 
between texts as well as looking at the significance and influence of the contexts in 
which they were produced and received. 
Learning outcomes 
Students are required to: 
● apply relevant methods for text analysis, drawing on linguistic and literary fields  
● apply varied strategies for reading and listening according to text type and 
purpose for study

Content 
Students will study one theme from a choice of four. Each theme will offer the 
choice of two prose fiction anchor texts and a choice of five other texts from the 
genres of prose fiction, drama and poetry.  
In addition to the study of two literary texts within a theme, students will also be 
expected to read widely across a range of non-fiction genres in preparation for 
responding to an unseen extract in Section A of the examination. Students will 
explore and evaluate the ways different writers convey similar themes and issues in 
different texts. The two studied texts will be assessed in Section B of the 
examination. 
Teaching will cover the study of one prose fiction anchor text and one other text 
from the prescribed list below. Both anchor texts may be studied if desired.

Non-examination assessment: Investigating 
and Creating Texts 
Overview 
The non-examination assessment component has been designed to allow students 
to demonstrate their skills as writers, crafting their own original texts for different 
audiences and purposes. In exploring the various forms of writing and the ways 
different writers use linguistic and literary techniques in texts, students will acquire 
the synthesised knowledge and understanding required to produce original pieces of 
writing. This component permits students to pursue their own interests, applying 
the skills they have developed to investigate a topic they are interested in.  
Learning outcomes 
Students are required to: 
● apply relevant methods for text analysis, drawing on linguistic and literary fields  
● apply varied strategies for reading and listening according to text type and 
purpose for study  
● identify and describe how meanings and effects are created and conveyed in 
texts  
● apply linguistic and literary methodologies and concepts to inform their 
responses to and interpretations of texts  
● explore connections across a wide range of literary and non-literary texts 
● show knowledge and understanding of the ways in which texts relate to the 
contexts in which they are produced and received  
● use English appropriately, accurately and creatively  
● use a range of techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of texts for different 
audiences and purposes, informed by wide reading and listening 
● explore the ways in which individual texts are interpreted by different readers

Content 
Students will choose a topic that reflects their personal interests, studying two texts 
that relate to their chosen topic. The two texts are free choice; however, they must 
be selected from different genres: one must be fiction and one non-fiction. 
Texts studied must be complete texts and may be selected from genres of fiction 
such as prose fiction, poetry, drama and short stories, and genres of non-fiction 
such as travel writing, journalism, reportage, diaries, biographies and collections of 
letters.  
Students should be encouraged to choose texts they would enjoy studying and 
exploring further. They are welcome to draw on texts named elsewhere in the 
specification that have not been selected by their centre for examination 
assessment. Texts that are set for study elsewhere in the specification, as well as 
those suggested in the example tasks below, should be considered indicative of the 
type and quality of texts appropriate for this component. 
Students will study their texts before producing their own original pieces of writing. 
They are also required to write an analytical commentary, explaining their 
decisions, the influence of their studied texts, the links and connections in their 
studied texts and their written pieces, and how their writing has been influenced by 
their wider reading and research.  
Teaching and wider reading will help students to develop their writing style through 
the synthesis of linguistic and literary knowledge and skills developed throughout 
the course. These include knowledge and skills pertaining to genre conventions, 
audience and purpose, connections between texts and the contexts in which texts 
are produced and received. 
Writing assignments 
Students will produce the two assignments: 
● Assignment 1: two pieces of original writing, one piece of fiction writing and 
one piece of creative non-fiction writing 
● Assignment 2: one separate analytical commentary reflecting on the studied 
texts and pieces of writing they have produced. 
Assignment 1: Original writing 
Students select a topic that will help to frame their investigation and provide 
adequate scope from which to find examples of fiction and non-fiction texts. The 
texts studied can act as a direct stimulus for students’ own writing or as style 
models. Students will be required to reflect on the influence of their studied texts in 
their accompanying commentaries. Students’ chosen texts should be supplemented 
by wider reading of literary and non-literary sources, which will be explored as 
background research for the chosen area of investigation. Texts studied for 
examination purposes should not be chosen as non-examination assessment texts.

Fiction and creative non-fiction 
Fiction deals with events that are imaginary, i.e. invented by the author. 
Creative non-fiction uses literary styles and techniques to create factually accurate 
texts. The subject matter should be documentable, i.e. chosen from the real world 
rather than invented from the writer’s mind. 
Assignment 2: Commentary 
Students will produce an analytical commentary to accompany their original writing. 
In their commentary, students will reflect on the writing process for both pieces.  
They should evaluate: 
● the findings of their initial research into the topic and texts 
● the influence of their studied texts and how they are reflected in their written 
pieces 
● the linguistic and literary features used in the style models that they have 
adopted in their own writing 
● the language choices they made, through the drafting process, to achieve 
effects appropriate to the chosen function and target audience 
Students should ensure that any texts and other sources used are accurately 
referenced.

Assignment setting, taking and marking 
Assignment setting 
When deciding on the assignments they will produce, students 
should be encouraged to draw on their own interests and skills, 
as well as applying what they have learned about language and 
literature. The choice of assignments should be made with 
teacher guidance to ensure that they are of an appropriate 
standard. 
Teachers are encouraged to use the assignment guidance 
service offered by Pearson to check the appropriate nature of 
assignments selected by students. 
It is advised that, due to the personal nature of the assignment 
selection each year, students complete different assignments 
from previous years. 
Centres are advised that checks will be carried out by Pearson 
to monitor adherence to the requirement that texts studied for 
examination should not be used in non-examination 
assessment. 
Assignment use 
Teachers should ensure that assignments chosen by students 
are relevant and appropriate to their course of learning. 
Students should have the opportunity to choose 
sources/interpretations/texts as appropriate. 
Assignment guidance service 
Pearson provides a free assignment guidance service. Please 
see our website (www.edexcel.com) for further details. 
Assignment research 
Teaching and learning 
Teachers should provide students with a short course of study 
that covers: 
● research and study skills 
● editing and proofreading skills 
● referencing and bibliography skills. 
Collaboration 
Students may work together on their research.

Feedback 
Teachers may help students to understand rubrics, assessment 
criteria and controls. Teachers must not give students solutions. 
For example, teachers may provide a simplified student friendly 
version of the assessment criteria, but this must not be specific 
to the work of individual students or a group of students (see 
the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) Instructions for 
conducting non-examination assessments (new GCE and GCSE 
specifications) on the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk). Any 
additional feedback must be recorded in the Non-examination 
Assessment Authentication Sheet (see Appendix 4). 
Resources 
Students must have equal access to IT resources. They should 
have access to a range of resources, interpretations and texts 
to enable them to make choices as required for their 
assignments. 
Assignment writing 
Authenticity 
Students and teachers must sign the Non-examination 
Assessment Authentication Sheet (see Appendix 4). Teachers 
must review at least one draft to offer support and to ensure 
they can verify that the student’s final work is their own. This 
support may take the form of general advice only and work 
may not be provisionally assessed. Please refer to the Joint 
Council for Qualifications (JCQ) Instructions for conducting non-
examination assessments (new GCE and GCSE specifications) 
on the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk for further information on 
the level of feedback permitted. 
Students must ensure that all quotations and citations are 
referenced using an established referencing system, such as 
Harvard, and produce a bibliography citing reference texts. 
Collaboration 
Students must not work with others when writing their 
assignments. Centres must ensure that the same teacher has 
reviewed all work from a class in order to be able to verify on 
the Non-examination Assessment Authentication Sheet that 
students’ work is their own. 
Feedback 
Teachers may help students to understand rubrics, assessment 
criteria and controls. Any additional feedback must be recorded 
on the Non-examination Assessment Authentication Sheet (see 
Appendix 4). Please refer to the Joint Council for Qualifications 
(JCQ) Instructions for conducting non-examination assessments 
(new GCE and GCSE specifications) on the JCQ website: 
www.jcq.org.uk for further information.

20 
Word count 
It is strongly recommended that students write between 1500 
and 2000 words for their fiction and creative non-fiction pieces 
and 1000 to 1250 words for their commentaries. The advisory 
total word count is between 2500 and 3250 words. This does 
not include footnotes and bibliographies. 
It is advisable that the upper word limit is adhered to by 
students to enable them to satisfy the requirement to produce a 
concise and coherently structured response. 
Assignment marking 
Teachers should mark the assignments using the assessment 
criteria on the following pages. Teachers may annotate 
students’ work. The marks awarded should be justified  
and teachers should add comments to the Non-examination 
Assessment Authentication Sheet (see Appendix 4). 
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in English Language and Literature 
Specification – Issue 6 – August 2024 © Pearson Education Limited 2024

Assessment criteria 
Teachers must mark students’ work using the assessment criteria on pages 22–24. 
Marking guidance  
● All candidates must receive the same treatment. Teachers must mark the last 
candidate in exactly the same way as they mark the first. 
● Mark schemes should be applied positively. Candidates must be rewarded for 
what they have shown they can do rather than be penalised for omissions. 
● All the marks on the mark scheme are designed to be awarded. Teachers should 
always award full marks if deserved, i.e. if the answer matches the mark 
scheme. Teachers should be prepared to award zero marks if the candidate’s 
response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme. 
The marking grids have been designed to assess student work holistically. The grids 
identify which Assessment Objective is being targeted by each bullet point in the 
level descriptors. Each bullet point is linked to one Assessment Objective, however 
please note that the number of bullet points in the level descriptor does not directly 
correlate to the number of marks in the level descriptor.  
When deciding how to reward an answer using a levels-based mark scheme, the 
‘best fit’ approach should be used. To do this teachers should: 
● first decide which level descriptor most closely matches the candidate answer 
and place it in that level 
● decide on the mark awarded in the level based on the quality of the answer and 
modify according to how securely all bullet point descriptors are met at that 
level 
● remember that in cases of uneven performance, all the above points still apply. 
Candidates are to be placed in the level that best describes their answer 
according to each of the Assessment Objectives described in the level. Marks 
are to be awarded towards the top or bottom of that level depending how they 
have evidenced each of the descriptor bullet points  
● remember that all Assessment Objectives in a level are equally weighted and 
take this into consideration when making their judgements.

Marking, standardisation and moderation 
The assignments are marked by teachers. Where marking 
for this qualification has been carried out by more than one 
teacher in a centre, a process of internal standardisation 
must be carried out to ensure that there is a consistent 
application of the assessment criteria. 
Marks awarded by the centre will be subject to external 
moderation by Pearson. Moderation will ensure consistency 
with national standards and will review assignments to 
ensure that the assignment setting rules have been 
correctly applied by centres. Pearson will notify centres of 
the students whose responses have been selected for 
moderation. This sample will take cohort size into account. 
If the moderation indicates that centre assessment does not 
reflect national standards, an adjustment will be made to 
students’ final marks to compensate.  
Please refer to the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) 
Instructions for conducting non-examination assessments 
(new GCE and GCSE specifications) on the JCQ website: 
www.jcq.org.uk for further information. The assessment in 
this qualification will comply with these instructions. 
Security and backups 
It is the responsibility of the centre to keep the work that 
students have submitted for assessment secure. 
Secure storage is defined as a securely locked cabinet or 
cupboard. 
Malpractice 
Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of 
assessment or which undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in non-examination assessments 
discovered before the candidate has signed the declaration 
of authentication form does not need to be reported to 
Pearson. 
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in English Language and Literature 
Specification – Issue 6 – August 2024 © Pearson Education Limited 2024 
26 
Candidate malpractice found in controlled assessments after 
the declaration of authenticity has been signed, and in 
examinations must be reported to Pearson on a  
JCQ M1 Form (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-
office/malpractice). The completed form can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to Investigations 
Team, Pearson, 190 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BH. 
Please provide as much information and supporting 
documentation as possible. Note that the final decision 
regarding appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report candidate malpractice constitutes staff or 
centre malpractice.  
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate 
malpractice and maladministration of our qualifications. As 
with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is 
any act that compromises or seeks to compromise the 
process of assessment or undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and 
maladministration must be reported immediately, before 
any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson 
on a JCQ M2(a) Form (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-
office/malpractice). The form, supporting documentation 
and as much information as possible can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to Investigations 
Team, Pearson, 190 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BH. Note 
that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies 
with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More-detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the 
latest version of the document JCQ General and Vocational 
Qualifications Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and 
Assessments, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-
office/malpractice.

Entry and assessment information 
Student entry 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for 
this qualification can be found in our UK Information 
Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations 
officers and is available on our website at: 
www.edexcel.com/iwantto/Pages/uk-information-
manual.aspx 
Forbidden combinations, discount code and 
performance tables 
There are no forbidden combinations with this qualification. 
Centres should be aware that students who enter for more 
than one GCE qualification with the same discount code will 
have only one of the grades they achieve counted for the 
purpose of the school and college performance tables. This 
will be the grade for the larger qualification (i.e. the A Level 
grade rather than the AS grade). If the qualifications are 
the same size, then the better grade will be counted (please 
see Appendix 3: Codes). 
Students should be advised that if they take two GCE 
qualifications with the same discount code, colleges, 
universities and employers they wish to progress to are 
likely to take the view that this achievement is equivalent to 
only one GCE. The same view may be taken if students take 
two GCE qualifications that have different discount codes 
but have significant overlap of content. Students or their 
advisers who have any doubts about their subject 
combinations should check with the institution they wish to 
progress to before embarking on their programmes. 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and 
special consideration 
Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. 
They allow students with special educational needs, 
disabilities or temporary injuries to:  
● access the assessment 
● show what they know and can do without changing the 
demands of the assessment.  
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in English Language and Literature 
Specification – Issue 6 – August 2024 © Pearson Education Limited 2024 
32 
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the 
particular needs of an individual student with a disability 
without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding 
bodies comply with the duty under the Equality Act 2010  
to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the 
start of the course. Students will then know what is 
available and have the access arrangement(s) in place  
for assessment.  
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation  
to make reasonable adjustments where a person with  
a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in 
undertaking an assessment. The awarding organisation  
is required to take reasonable steps to overcome that 
disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular person may be 
unique to that individual and therefore might not be in the 
list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will 
depend on a number of factors, which will include: 
● the needs of the student with the disability 
● the effectiveness of the adjustment 
● the cost of the adjustment; and 
● the likely impact of the adjustment on the student  
with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves 
unreasonable costs to the awarding organisation, 
timeframes or affects the security or integrity of the 
assessment. This is because the adjustment is not

Equality Act 2010 and Pearson equality policy 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality 
policy requires all students to have equal opportunity to 
access our qualifications and assessments, and our 
qualifications to be awarded in a way that is fair to  
every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
● students with a protected characteristic (as defined  
by the Equality Act 2010) are not, when they are 
undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged  
in comparison to students who do not share that 
characteristic 
● all students achieve the recognition they deserve for 
undertaking a qualification and that this achievement 
can be compared fairly to the achievement of their 
peers.

Synoptic assessment 
Synoptic assessment requires students to work across 
different parts of a qualification and to show their 
accumulated knowledge and understanding of a topic  
or subject area. 
Synoptic assessment enables students to show their ability 
to combine their skills, knowledge and understanding with 
breadth and depth of the subject.  
Students draw together skills synoptically in their analysis 
and evaluation of texts. This occurs throughout the 
qualification and assessment. 
Awarding and reporting 
This qualification will be graded, awarded and certificated  
to comply with the requirements of the current Code of 
Practice published by the Office of Qualifications and 
Examinations Regulation (Ofqual). 
The Advanced GCE qualification will be graded and 
certificated on a six-grade scale from A* to E using the  
total subject mark. Individual components are not graded. 
The first certification opportunity for the Pearson Edexcel 
Level 3 Advanced GCE in English Language and Literature 
will be 2017. 
Students whose level of achievement is below the minimum 
judged by Pearson to be of sufficient standard to be 
recorded on a certificate will receive an unclassified  
U result. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will be available in English. 
All student work must be in English.

Other information 
Student recruitment 
Students are advised against making entries for more than 
one A level in English. Examinations for A level English 
Language and A level English Language and Literature are 
timetabled at the same time. 
Pearson follows the JCQ policy concerning recruitment to 
our qualifications in that: 
● they must be available to anyone who is capable of 
reaching the required standard 
● they must be free from barriers that restrict access and 
progression 
● equal opportunities exist for all students. 
Prior learning and other requirements 
There are no prior learning or other requirements for this 
qualification. 
Students who would benefit most from studying an 
Advanced GCE in English Language and Literature are likely 
to have a Level 2 qualification such as a GCSE in English 
Language or English Literature. 
Progression 
Students can progress from this qualification to: 
● higher education courses such as degrees in English, 
English literature, creative writing or in related subjects 
such as journalism, media, teaching, drama, history 
● a wide range of careers either directly related to English 
language or literature, such as teacher, editor, writer,  
or in areas such as publishing, journalism, the media, 
advertising, marketing, public relations, arts 
administration, record offices, libraries, national  
and local government and the civil service.

Relationship between Advanced Subsidiary GCE and 
Advanced GCE 
The Advanced Subsidiary GCE is a discrete linear 
qualification and comprises two examined components; 
these are built from content that is common with the 
Advanced GCE but they have different assessments that 
take place at the end of the course.  
Relationship between GCSE and Advanced GCE 
Students will combine the skills developed in the separate 
qualifications of GCSE English Literature and GCSE English 
Language and learn to apply these to texts in an integrated 
approach.  
Progression from GCSE to Advanced GCE 
This qualification provides progression from GCSE building 
on skills of analysing, evaluating and comparing texts and 
transactional writing skills, including accurate spelling, 
punctuation and grammar. It can, for example, allow 
students to develop a broader and deeper understanding of 
English Language and Literature as a discipline and allow 
them to develop higher English Language and Literature 
skills.

Appendix 1: Transferable skills 
 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently 
flagged the need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable 
them to respond with confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the 
world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines 
skills, or competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that 
can be learned and that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform 
an activity or task and can be built upon and extended through learning.’
1 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected 
and evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this 
process, we identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework as the 
most evidence-based and robust skills framework. We adapted the framework 
slightly to include the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) ICT 
Literacy and Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) Skills. 
The adapted National Research Council’s framework of skills involves:2 
Cognitive skills 
● Non-routine problem solving – expert thinking, metacognition, creativity. 
● Systems thinking – decision making and reasoning. 
● Critical thinking – definitions of critical thinking are broad and usually involve 
general cognitive skills such as analysing, synthesising and reasoning skills. 
● ICT literacy – access, manage, integrate, evaluate, construct and 
communicate3. 
Interpersonal skills 
● Communication – active listening, oral communication, written 
communication, assertive communication and non-verbal communication. 
● Relationship-building skills – teamwork, trust, intercultural sensitivity, 
service orientation, self-presentation, social influence, conflict resolution and 
negotiation. 
● Collaborative problem solving – establishing and maintaining shared 
understanding, taking appropriate action, establishing and maintaining team 
organisation.

Intrapersonal skills 
● Adaptability – ability and willingness to cope with the uncertain, handling work 
stress, adapting to different personalities, communication styles and cultures, 
and physical adaptability to various indoor and outdoor work environments. 
● Self-management and self-development – ability to work remotely in virtual 
teams, work autonomously, be self-motivating and self-monitoring, willing and 
able to acquire new information and skills related to work. 
Transferable skills are the skills that enable young people to face the demands of 
further and higher education, as well as the demands of the workplace, and are 
important in the teaching and learning of this qualification. We will provide teaching 
and learning materials, developed with stakeholders, to support our qualifications.

Appendix 2: Level 3 Extended Project 
qualification 
 
What is the Extended Project? 
The Extended Project is a standalone qualification that can be taken alongside 
GCEs. It supports the development of independent learning skills and helps to 
prepare students for their next step – whether that be higher education or 
employment. The qualification: 
● is recognised by higher eduction for the skills it develops 
● is worth half of an Advanced GCE qualification at grades A*–E  
● carries UCAS points for university entry. 
The Extended Project encourages students to develop skills in the following areas: 
research, critical thinking, extended writing and project management. Students 
identify and agree a topic area of their choice (which may or may not be related to 
a GCE subject they are already studying), guided by their teacher. 
Students can choose from one of four approaches to produce: 
● a dissertation (for example, an investigation based on predominately secondary 
research) 
● an investigation/field study (for example, a practical experiment) 
● a performance (for example, in music, drama or sport) 
● an artefact (for example, a creating a sculpture in response to a client brief or 
solving an engineering problem). 
The qualification is non-examination assessment based and students are assessed 
on the skills of managing, planning and evaluating their project. Students will 
research their topic, develop skills to review and evaluate the information, and then 
present the final outcome of their project. 
Students: what they need to do 
The Extended Project qualification requires students to: 
● select a topic of interest for an in-depth study and negotiate the scope of the 
project with their teacher 
● identify and draft an objective for their project (for example, in the form of a 
question, hypothesis, challenge, outline of proposed performance, issue to be 
investigated or commission for a client) and provide a rationale for their choice 
● produce a plan for how they will deliver their intended objective 
● conduct research as required by the project brief, using appropriate techniques 
● carry out the project using tools and techniques safely 
● share the outcome of the project using appropriate communication methods, 
including a presentation. 
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in English Language and Literature 
Specification – Issue 6 – August 2024 © Pearson Education Limited 2024 
42 
Teachers: key information 
● The Extended Project has 120 guided learning hours (GLH) consisting of: 
o a taught 40-GLH element that includes teaching the technical skills  
(for example research skills) 
o a guided 80-GLH element that includes mentoring students through the 
project work. 
● Group work is acceptable, however it is important that each student provides 
evidence of their own contribution and produces their own report. 
● 100% externally moderated. 
● Four Assessment Objectives: manage, use resources, develop and realise, 
review. 
● Can be run over 1, 1½ or 2 years. 
● Can be submitted in January or June. 
How to link the Extended Project with English Language and Literature 
The Extended Project creates the opportunity to develop transferable skills for 
progression to higher education and to the workplace. It does this through students 
exploring an area of personal interest or a topic of interest from the English 
Language and Literature qualification content. For example English Language and 
Literature students could work on a dissertation that explores an aspect of English 
Language and Literature. 
Skills developed 
Through what they are taught and from their work on other projects it is expected 
that Extended Project students will develop skills in the following areas: 
● independent research skills, including skills in primary research and the 
selection of appropriate methods for data collection 
● extended reading and academic writing, including reading academic articles 
● planning/project management, including the refining of research questions 
● source handling and evaluation 
● evaluation of arguments and processes, including arguments in favour of 
alternative interpretations of sources and evaluation of the research process 
● critical thinking. 
In the context of the Extended Project, critical thinking refers to the ability to 
identify and develop arguments for a point of view or hypothesis, and the ability to 
consider and to respond to alternative arguments. 
The Extended Project is an ideal vehicle to develop the transferable skills identified 
in Appendix 1.

Using the Extended Project to support breadth and depth 
Students are not expected to study specified material. In the Extended Project, 
students are assessed on the quality of the work they produce and the skills they 
develop and demonstrate through working on it. English Language and Literature 
students should demonstrate that they have extended themselves in some 
significant way by means of their Extended Project. It is important that students 
show at the outset how their work involves significant extension beyond what they 
have been studying in English Language and Literature. Students can use the 
Extended Project to demonstrate extension in one or more dimensions: 
● deepening understanding: this is where a student explores a topic in greater 
depth than in the specification content. A student of English Language and 
Literature could choose to carry out a deeper, more analytic, exploration of a 
concept that can be explored through the lens of textual or linguistic study. For 
example, questions about the nature of language and literature or exploration of 
a concept such as identity or meaning 
● broadening skills: this is where a student learns a new skill, for example 
performance skills 
● widening perspectives: this is where a student’s project spans different 
subjects and involves cross-curricular exploration that looks at, for example, 
political, social, philosophical and psychological aspects of the question. 
Choosing topics and narrowing down to a question 
Topics or titles linked to the themes from the English Language and Literature 
qualification could inspire a choice of Extended Project topic. 
As an example of an English Language and Literature related project, consider a 
student who, having studied Hamlet, decided to explore the question of how 
identity is defined, using the text of the play as a central source. The student’s 
dissertation contained a literature review, examining the way in which the concept 
of identity figures in Hamlet, and exploring it through engagement with 
commentaries on the play. In the discussion section, the student critically examined 
some philosophical aspects of the question of identity, using points from Hamlet to 
exemplify them. The project concluded with a review of the research process and 
an oral presentation of the main findings. 
Examples of dissertation titles: 
● Does the work of Christopher Marlowe illustrate the idea that works of art reflect 
rather than initiate social changes? 
● Is it possible to produce tragedy in the modern era? 
● Is poetry essential to religious literature? 
● Is authorial intent irrelevant when we are seeking to interpret a text? 
● How far are we products and how far are we masters of language? 
● Can people think and express themselves without language? 
● Is femininity socially or biologically constructed?

Students who wish to extend their creative writing skills can produce an artefact. 
The emphasis in the assessment criteria is on the process leading up to the finished 
piece of work. Consider a student who wished to write a short science-fiction story. 
They wrote a literature review that contained research into genre, influences and 
source materials for the story, and the processes and techniques of creative 
writing. As well as submitting the finished story, the student included extracts from 
drafts annotated to show the development of ideas and the creative decisions they 
made during the development of the work, including reflection on alternative 
possibilities and evaluation of their relative merits. 
There is scope for English Language and Literature based performance Extended 
Projects. For example, a student might perform scenes from a text they are 
studying.
