 From Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class Qualifications 
 
  The reform of the qualifications system in England is a profoundly important 
change to the education system. Teachers need to know that the new qualifications 
will assist them in helping their learners make progress in their lives. 
When these changes were first proposed we were approached by Pearson to join an 
‘Expert Panel’ that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. 
We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or 
because of our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the 
world as diverse as Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries 
across Europe. 
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification 
development process that has included: 
 Extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-
performing jurisdictions in the world 
 Benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that 
they are at the right level of demand 
 Establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-
specific expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications 
 Subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual 
accreditation criteria in advance of submission.  
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future 
oriented. The design has been guided by what is called an ‘Efficacy Framework’, 
meaning learner outcomes have been at the heart of this development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a 
learner’s success in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident 
that we have supported the development of qualifications that are outstanding for 
their coherence, thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as 
representing world-class best practice.

Introduction 
The Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Economics B is designed for use in 
schools and colleges. It is part of a suite of GCE qualifications offered by Pearson. 
Purpose of the specification 
This specification sets out: 
● the objectives of the qualification 
● any other qualification(s) that a student must have completed before taking the 
qualification 
● any prior knowledge and skills that the student is required to have before taking 
the qualification 
● any other requirements that a student must have satisfied before they will be 
assessed or before the qualification will be awarded 
● the knowledge and understanding that will be assessed as part of the 
qualification

(such as assessment criteria). 
 
 
 
Rationale 
The Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Economics B meets the following 
purposes, which fulfil those defined by the Office of Qualifications and Examinations 
Regulation (Ofqual) for GCE qualifications in their GCE Qualification Level 
Conditions and Requirements document, published in April 2014. 
The purposes of this qualification are to: 
● define and assess achievement of the knowledge, skills and understanding that 
will be needed by students planning to progress to undergraduate study at a UK 
higher education establishment, particularly (although not only) in the same 
subject area, for example economics, degrees in applied economics such as 
environmental economics, labour economics, public sector economics or 
monetary economics, business economics, or a business degree 
● set out a robust and internationally comparable post-16 academic course of 
study to develop that knowledge, skills and understanding 
● enable UK universities to accurately identify the level of attainment of students 
● provide a basis for school and college accountability measures at age 18 
● provide a benchmark of academic ability for employers. 
Qualification aims and objectives 
The aims and objectives of the Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in 
Economics B are to enable students to: 
● develop an interest in, and enthusiasm for, the subject 
● appreciate the contribution of economics to the understanding of the wider 
economic and social environment 
● develop an understanding of a range of concepts and an ability to use those 
concepts in a variety of different contexts 
● use an enquiring, critical and thoughtful approach to the study of economics and 
develop an ability to think as an economist 
● understand that economic behaviour can be studied from a range of 
perspectives 
● develop analytical and quantitative skills, together with qualities and attitudes 
that will equip them for the challenges, opportunities and responsibilities of 
adult and working life. 
 
The context for the development of this qualification 
All our qualifications are designed to meet our World Class Qualification Principles[1] 
and our ambition to put the student at the heart of everything we do. 
We have developed and designed this qualification by: 
● reviewing other curricula and qualifications to ensure that it is comparable with 
those taken in high-performing jurisdictions overseas 
● consulting with key stakeholders on content and assessment, including learned 
bodies, subject associations, higher-education academics, teachers and 
employers to ensure this qualification is suitable for a UK context 
● reviewing the legacy qualification and building on its positive attributes. 
This qualification has also been developed to meet criteria stipulated by Ofqual in 
their documents GCE Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements and GCE 
Subject Level Conditions and Requirements for Economics, published in April 2014. 
 
 
 
[1] Pearson’s World Class Qualification principles ensure that our qualifications are: 
● demanding, through internationally benchmarked standards, encouraging deep 
learning and measuring higher-order skills 
● rigorous, through setting and maintaining standards over time, developing 
reliable and valid assessment tasks and processes, and generating confidence in 
end users of the knowledge, skills and competencies of certified students 
● inclusive, through conceptualising learning as continuous, recognising that 
students develop at different rates and have different learning needs, and 
focusing on progression 
● empowering, through promoting the development of transferable skills,  
see Appendix 1.

Knowledge, skills and understanding 
Theme 1: Markets, consumers and firms 
 
Overview 
In this theme, students explore the way in which consumers 
make choices and entrepreneurs create desirable products. 
Students will need to build upon the knowledge, skills and 
understanding developed in Theme 1 in Theme 4, making 
connections across these two themes in Paper 1, and across 
Themes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in Paper 3. Teaching approaches to 
content must reflect this. 
Students will need to apply their knowledge and 
understanding of both familiar and unfamiliar contexts in 
the assessments, and demonstrate an awareness of current 
economic events and policies. Students should have 
knowledge of the UK economy in the last 10 years. 
Content 
Students will learn about the market economy and how 
market forces shape the way in which firms meet consumer 
demand, how firms raise the finance they need and how 
they measure their performance. 
Students will consider how markets work, looking at how 
supply and demand interact to allocate resources in local, 
national and international markets. They will learn how to 
apply supply and demand analysis to real-world situations 
and be able to offer explanations to explain consumer 
behaviour. 
Having investigated how markets work, students will then 
look at market failure. They will look at the nature and 
causes of market failure before considering the strengths 
and weaknesses of possible government interventions to 
remedy market failure. 
Students are encouraged to use an enquiring, critical and 
thoughtful approach to the study of economics and to 
develop an ability to think as an economist. 
To develop their skills, knowledge and understanding in 
economics, students need to have acquired competence in 
quantitative skills that are relevant to, and applied in the 
context of, this theme (see Appendix 3: Quantitative skills). 
For this theme, students will need to be aware of the 
accounting ratios outlined in Appendix 4: Accounting ratios.

Theme 2: The wider economic environment 
 
Overview 
This theme helps students to explore how firms can become 
more competitive. It introduces them to the wider 
international and economic environment in which firms 
operate. 
Students will need to build upon the knowledge, skills and 
understanding developed in Theme 2 in Theme 3, making 
connections across these two themes in Paper 2, and across 
Themes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in Paper 3. Teaching approaches to 
content must reflect this. 
Students will need to apply their knowledge and 
understanding of both familiar and unfamiliar contexts in 
the assessments, and demonstrate an awareness of current 
economic events and policies. Students should have 
knowledge of the UK economy in the last 10 years. 
Content 
Business growth and competitive advantage lead naturally 
to the ways in which consumers are influenced by and 
respond to changes in prices and incomes. This theme goes 
on to develop an understanding of the nature of productive 
efficiency and the need to improve it. At this point, the 
theme broadens out to cover global issues, fluctuations in 
the economy and the ways in which governments respond 
to threats and changes with micro- and macro-economic 
policies. 
Students will consider the different approaches that may be 
used by policy-makers to address the main economic 
issues. 
Students are encouraged to use an enquiring, critical and 
thoughtful approach to the study of economics and develop

Theme 3: The global economy 
 
Overview 
This theme builds on the content of Theme 2: The wider 
economic environment and continues its focus on the 
international economic environment. 
Students will need to build upon the knowledge, skills and 
understanding developed in Theme 2 in Theme 3, making 
connections across these two themes in Paper 2, and across 
Themes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in Paper 3. Teaching approaches to 
content must reflect this. 
Students will need to apply their knowledge and 
understanding of both familiar and unfamiliar contexts in 
the assessments, and demonstrate an awareness of current 
economic events and policies. Students should have 
knowledge of the UK economy in the last 10 years. 
Content 
Students develop their understanding of the meaning of 
globalisation. They then go on to explore ways in which 
firms expand into new markets and move to new locations 
for production, alongside looking at the issues relating to 
global trade and growth, and the trade policies that shape 
the global economy. Multinational corporations figure 
significantly in this theme, along with the study of global 
labour markets, poverty, inequality and income distribution. 
Students will apply supply and demand analysis to the 
labour market as they see how wages are determined and 
look at other influences on the rewards of labour. 
Students are encouraged to use an enquiring, critical and 
thoughtful approach to the study of economics and develop 
an ability to think as an economist. 
To develop their skills, knowledge and understanding in 
economics, students need to have acquired competence in 
quantitative skills that are relevant to and applied in the 
context of this theme (see Appendix 3: Quantitative skills).

Theme 4: Making markets work 
 
Overview 
This theme starts by considering degrees of competition 
within markets and then encourages students to apply their 
understanding to how governments may improve the 
functioning of markets and the economy. 
Students will need to build upon the knowledge, skills and 
understanding developed in Theme 1 in Theme 4, making 
connections across these two themes in Paper 1, and across 
Themes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in Paper 3. Teaching approaches to 
content must reflect this. 
Students will need to apply their knowledge and 
understanding of both familiar and unfamiliar contexts in 
the assessments, and demonstrate an awareness of current 
economic events and policies. Students should have 
knowledge of the UK economy in the last 10 years. 
Content 
Students will investigate competition and market power in 
this theme, as well as other aspects of market failure, 
covered in greater depth from Theme 1: Markets, 
consumers and firms. The focus on regulation opens up the 
range of measures that can be used to prevent firms from 
using their market power in ways that are detrimental to 
the interests of society as a whole. 
In-depth coverage of macroeconomic policy and the role of 
the financial markets allows students to explore the 
significant problems that have developed in recent years 
without needing technical understanding of the financial 
system. 
Students are encouraged to use an enquiring, critical and 
thoughtful approach to the study of economics and develop 
an ability to think as an economist. 
To develop their skills, knowledge and understanding in 
economics, students need to have acquired competence in 
quantitative skills that are relevant to and applied in the 
context of this theme (see Appendix 3: Quantitative skills).

Entry and assessment information 
Student entry 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for 
this qualification can be found in our UK Information 
Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations 
officers and is available on our website at: 
www.edexcel.com/iwantto/Pages/uk-information-
manual.aspx 
Forbidden combinations and discount code 
Centres should be aware that students who enter for more 
than one GCE qualification with the same discount code will 
have only one of the grades they achieve counted for the 
purpose of the School and College Performance Tables – 
normally the better grade (please see Appendix 5: Codes). 
Students should be advised that, if they take two 
qualifications with the same discount code, colleges, 
universities and employers are very likely to take the view 
that they have achieved only one of the two GCEs. The 
same view may be taken if students take two GCE 
qualifications that have different discount codes but have 
significant overlap of content, for example Advanced or 
Advanced Subsidiary GCEs in Business. Students or their 
advisers who have any doubts about their subject 
combinations should check with the institution to which 
they wish to progress before embarking on their 
programmes. 
This qualification is a forbidden combination with Advanced 
Subsidiary GCE in Economics A or Advanced GCE in 
Economics A qualifications. 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and 
special consideration 
Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. 
They allow students with special educational needs, 
disabilities or temporary injuries to: 
● access the assessment 
● show what they know and can do without changing the 
demands of the assessment. 
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the 
particular needs of an individual disabled student without 
affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding 
bodies comply with the duty under the Equality Act 2010 to 
make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Economics B 
Specification – Issue 1 – September 2014 © Pearson Education Limited 2014 
42 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the 
start of the course. Students will then know what is 
available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for 
assessment.  
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to 
make reasonable adjustments where a person with a 
disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in 
undertaking an assessment. The awarding organisation is 
required to take reasonable steps to overcome that 
disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular person may be 
unique to that individual and therefore might not be in the 
list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will 
depend on a number of factors, which will include: 
● the needs of the student with the disability 
● the effectiveness of the adjustment 
● the cost of the adjustment; and 
● the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with 
the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves 
unreasonable costs to the awarding organisation, 
timeframes or affects the security or integrity of the 
assessment. This is because the adjustment is not 
‘reasonable’. 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a 
student's mark or grade to reflect temporary injury, illness 
or other indisposition at the time of the 
examination/assessment, which has had, or is reasonably 
likely to have had, a material effect on a candidate’s ability 
to take an assessment or demonstrate his or her level of 
attainment in an assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for further information about how to 
apply for access arrangements and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, 
reasonable adjustments and special consideration, please 
refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk.

Equality Act 2010 and Pearson equality policy 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality 
policy requires all students to have equal opportunity to 
access our qualifications and assessments, and our 
qualifications to be awarded in a way that is fair to every 
student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
● students with a protected characteristic (as defined by 
the Equality Act 2010) are not, when they are 
undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in 
comparison to students who do not share that 
characteristic 
● all students achieve the recognition they deserve for 
undertaking a qualification and that this achievement 
can be compared fairly to the achievement of their 
peers. 
You can find details on how to make adjustments for 
students with protected characteristics in the policy 
document Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments 
and Special Considerations, which is on our website, 
www.edexcel.com/Policies. 
Synoptic assessment 
Synoptic assessment requires students to work across 
different parts of a qualification and to show their 
accumulated knowledge and understanding of a topic or 
subject area. 
Synoptic assessment enables students to show their ability 
to combine their skills, knowledge and understanding with 
breadth and depth of the subject. 
In this qualification, synoptic assessment can be found in 
Paper 3: The economic environment and business. 
Awarding and reporting 
This qualification will be graded, awarded and certificated to 
comply with the requirements of the current Code of 
Practice, published by the Office of Qualifications and 
Examinations Regulation (Ofqual). 
The Advanced GCE qualification will be graded and 
certificated on a six-grade scale from A* to E using the total 
subject mark. Individual papers are not graded. 
The first certification opportunity for the Pearson Edexcel 
Level 3 Advanced GCE in Economics B will be 2017. 
Students whose level of achievement is below the minimum 
judged by Pearson to be of sufficient standard to be 
recorded on a certificate will receive an unclassified U 
result.

Appendix 1: Transferable skills 
 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently 
flagged the need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable 
them to respond with confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the 
world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines 
skills, or competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that 
can be learned and that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform 
an activity or task and can be built upon and extended through learning.’1 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected 
and evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this 
process, we identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework as the 
most evidence-based and robust skills framework. We adapted the framework 
slightly to include the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) ICT 
Literacy and Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) Skills. 
The adapted National Research Council’s framework of skills involves:2 
Cognitive skills 
● Non-routine problem solving – expert thinking, metacognition, creativity. 
● Systems thinking – decision making and reasoning. 
● Critical thinking – definitions of critical thinking are broad and usually involve 
general cognitive skills such as analysing, synthesising and reasoning skills. 
● ICT literacy – access, manage, integrate, evaluate, construct and 
communicate3. 
Interpersonal skills 
● Communication – active listening, oral communication, written 
communication, assertive communication and non-verbal communication. 
● Relationship-building skills – teamwork, trust, intercultural sensitivity, 
service orientation, self-presentation, social influence, conflict resolution and 
negotiation. 
● Collaborative problem solving – establishing and maintaining shared 
understanding, taking appropriate action, establishing and maintaining team 
organisation.

Intrapersonal skills 
● Adaptability – ability and willingness to cope with the uncertain, handling work 
stress, adapting to different personalities, communication styles and cultures, 
and physical adaptability to various indoor and outdoor work environments. 
● Self-management and self-development – ability to work remotely in virtual 
teams, work autonomously, be self-motivating and self-monitoring, willing and 
able to acquire new information and skills related to work. 
Transferable skills enable young people to face the demands of further and higher 
education, as well as the demands of the workplace, and are important in the 
teaching and learning of this qualification. We will provide teaching and learning 
materials, developed with stakeholders, to support our qualifications.

Appendix 2: Level 3 Extended Project 
qualification 
 
What is the Extended Project? 
● The Extended Project is a standalone qualification that can be taken alongside 
GCEs. It supports the development of independent learning skills and helps to 
prepare students for their next step – whether that be university study or 
employment. The qualification: 
● is recognised by universities for the skills it develops 
● is worth half of an Advanced GCE qualification at grades A*–E 
● carries UCAS points for university entry. 
The Extended Project encourages students to develop skills in the following areas: 
research, critical thinking, extended writing and project management. Students 
identify and agree a topic area of their choice (which may or may not be related to 
a GCE subject they are already studying), guided by their teacher. 
Students can choose from one of four approaches to produce: 
● a dissertation (for example an investigation based on predominately secondary 
research) 
● an investigation/field study (for example a practical experiment) 
● a performance (for example in music, drama or sport) 
● an artefact (for example a creating a sculpture in response to a client brief or 
solving an engineering problem). 
The qualification is coursework based and students are assessed on the skills of 
managing, planning and evaluating their project. Students will research their topic, 
develop skills to review and evaluate the information, and then present the final 
outcome of their project. 
Students: what they need to do 
The Extended Project qualification requires students to: 
● select a topic of interest for an in-depth study and negotiate the scope of the 
project with their teacher 
● identify and draft an objective for their project (for example in the form of a 
question, hypothesis, challenge, outline of proposed performance, issue to be 
investigated or commission for a client) and provide a rationale for their choice 
● produce a plan for how they will deliver their intended objective 
● conduct research as required by the project brief, using appropriate techniques 
● carry out the project using tools and techniques safely 
● share the outcome of the project using appropriate communication methods, 
including a presentation. 
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Economics B 
Specification – Issue 1 – September 2014 © Pearson Education Limited 2014 
52 
Teachers: key information 
● The Extended Project has 120 guided learning hours (GLH) consisting of: 
o a 40-GLH taught element that includes teaching the technical skills (for 
example research skills) 
o an 80-GLH guided element that includes mentoring students through the 
project work. 
● Group work is acceptable, however it is important that each student provides 
evidence of their own contribution and produces their own report. 
● 100% externally moderated. 
● Four Assessment Objectives: manage, use resources, develop and realise, 
review. 
● Can be run over 1, 1½ or 2 years. 
● Can be submitted in January or June. 
What is the Extended Project for Economics? 
The Extended Project creates the opportunity to develop transferable skills for 
progression to higher education and to the workplace, through the exploration of 
either an area of personal interest or a topic of interest within the Economics 
qualification content. Through the study of this Economics qualification, students 
will develop knowledge and understanding of economic concepts and issues; apply 
these concepts and issues to-real world contexts; then analyse and evaluate these 
concepts and issues. 
Skills developed 
Through the Extended Project students will develop skills in: 
● conducting, organising and using research 
● independent reading in the subject area 
● planning, project management and time management 
● defining a hypothesis to be tested in investigations or developing a design brief 
● collecting, handling and interpreting data and evidence 
● evaluating arguments and processes, including arguments in favour of 
alternative interpretations of data and evaluation of experimental methodology 
● critical thinking. 
In the context of the Extended Project, critical thinking refers to the ability to 
identify and develop arguments for a point of view or hypothesis and to consider 
and respond to alternative arguments. This supports the development of evaluative 
skills, through evaluating economic arguments, and using qualitative and 
quantitative evidence to support informed judgements relating to economic issues. 
The Extended Project is an ideal vehicle to develop the skills identified in 
Appendix 1. 
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Economics B 
Specification – Issue 1 – September 2014 © Pearson Education Limited 2014 
53 
Types of Extended Project 
Students may choose a university-style dissertation on any topic that can be 
researched and argued, for example: 
● a controversial economic issue such as UK membership of the EU 
● High Speed rail (HS2) 
● the government’s role in reducing pollution. 
A dissertation might involve an investigation such as: 
● Is fair trade actually fair? 
● Does income inequality help or harm economic growth? 
● Taxing wealth is less harmful than taxing income or spending. 
The dissertation uses secondary research sources to provide a reasoned defence or 
a point of view, with consider of counter arguments. 
An alternative might be an investigative project or field study involving the 
collection of data from primary research, for example: 
● a study of the impact of unemployment on the local community 
● a statistical survey of attitudes concerning a social issue such as alcohol or drug 
use. 
A field study might consider an issue which lends itself to primary research, for 
example: 
● the impact of peer pressure on teenage mobile phone purchasing 
● an investigation into whether teenage binge drinking is a supply-side not a 
demand-side problem. 
Using the Extended Project to support breadth and depth 
There is no specified material that students are expected to study and, in the 
Extended Project, students are assessed on the quality of the work they produce 
and the skills they develop and demonstrate through completing this work. 
Students can use the Extended Project to demonstrate extension in one or more 
dimensions: 
● deepening understanding: where a student explores a topic in greater depth 
than in the specification content 
● broadening skills: where a student learns a new skill. This might be learning 
how to design a website or learning a new statistical technique which can be 
used in the analysis of either primary or secondary data collected by the student 
● widening perspectives: where the student’s project spans different subjects. 
A student studying Economics with History may wish to research the influence 
of an economic thinker such as Keynes or Hayek. A student studying Economics 
with Geography may wish to research the economic development of a particular 
country or the impact of an industry on the landscape. A student studying 
Economics with Mathematics may wish to use statistical techniques to analyse 
macroeconomic data and research one aspect of the economy in more detail. A 
student studying Economics with Psychology may wish to conduct an 
experiment into economic behaviour. 
A wide range of information to support the delivery and assessment of the 
Extended Project, including the specification, teacher guidance for all aspects, 
editable scheme of work and exemplars for all four approaches, can be found on 
our website www.edexcel.com/project
