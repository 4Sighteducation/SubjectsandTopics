1 Introduction 
Why choose Edexcel A Level Mathematics? 
We have listened to feedback from all parts of the mathematics subject community, including 
higher education. We have used this opportunity of curriculum change to redesign a 
qualification that reflects the demands of a wide variety of end users, as well as retaining 
many of the features that have contributed to the increasing popularity of GCE Mathematics 
in recent years. 
We will provide: 
● Simple, intuitive specifications that enable co-teaching and parallel delivery. Increased 
pressure on teaching time means that it’s important you can cover the content of different 
specifications together. Our specifications are designed to help you co-teach A and 
AS Level, as well as deliver maths and further maths in parallel. 
● Clear, familiar, accessible exams. Our new exam papers will deliver everything you’d 
expect from us as the leading awarding body for maths. They’ll take the most 
straightforward and logical approach to meet the government’s requirements. They’ll use 
the same clear design that you’ve told us makes them so accessible, while also ensuring a 
range of challenge for all abilities. 
● A wide range of exam practice to fully prepare students and help you track progress. 
With the new linear exams your students will want to feel fully prepared and know how 
they’re progressing. We’ll provide lots of exam practice to help you and your students 
understand and prepare for the assessments, including secure mock papers, practice 
papers and free topic tests with marking guidance. 
● Complete support and free materials to help you understand and deliver the 
specification. Change is easier with the right support, so we’ll be on hand to listen and 
give advice on how to understand and implement the changes. Whether it’s through our 
Launch, Getting Ready to Teach, and Collaborative Networks events or via the renowned 
Maths Emporium, we’ll be available face to face, online or over the phone throughout the 
lifetime of the qualification. We’ll also provide you with free materials such as schemes of 
work, topic tests and progression maps. 
● The published resources you know and trust, fully updated for 2017. Our new A Level 
Maths and Further Maths textbooks retain all the features you know and love about the 
current series, while being fully updated to match the new specifications. Each textbook 
comes packed with additional online content that supports independent learning and they 
all tie in with the free qualification support, giving you the most coherent approach to 
teaching and learning.

Overarching themes 
The overarching themes should be applied along with associated mathematical thinking and 
understanding, across the whole of the detailed content in this specification. 
These overarching themes are inherent throughout the content and students are required to 
develop skills in working scientifically over the course of this qualification. The skills show 
teachers which skills need to be included as part of the learning and assessment of the 
students. 
Overarching theme 1: Mathematical argument, language and proof 
A Level Mathematics students must use the mathematical notation set out in the booklet 
Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables and be able to recall the mathematical 
formulae and identities set out in Appendix 1. 
 Knowledge/skill 
OT1.1 Construct and present mathematical arguments through appropriate use of 
diagrams; sketching graphs; logical deduction; precise statements involving 
correct use of symbols and connecting language, including: constant, 
coefficient, expression, equation, function, identity, index, term, variable. 
OT1.2 Understand and use mathematical language and syntax as set out in the 
content.

and abstract appropriately to enable problems to be solved. 
OT2.2 Construct extended arguments to solve problems presented in an 
unstructured form, including problems in context. 
OT2.3 Interpret and communicate solutions in the context of the original problem. 
OT2.4 Understand that many mathematical problems cannot be solved analytically, 
but numerical methods permit solution to a required level of accuracy. 
OT2.5 Evaluate, including by making reasoned estimates, the accuracy or limitations 
of solutions, including those obtained using numerical methods. 
OT2.6 Understand the concept of a mathematical problem-solving cycle, including 
specifying the problem, collecting information, processing and representing 
information and interpreting results, which may identify the need to repeat 
the cycle. 
OT2.7 Understand, interpret and extract information from diagrams and construct 
mathematical diagrams to solve problems, including in mechanics. 
 
Overarching theme 3: Mathematical modelling 
 Knowledge/skill 
OT3.1 Translate a situation in context into a mathematical model, making 
simplifying assumptions. 
OT3.2 Use a mathematical model with suitable inputs to engage with and explore 
situations (for a given model or a model constructed or selected  
by the student). 
OT3.3 Interpret the outputs of a mathematical model in the context of the original 
situation (for a given model or a model constructed or selected 
by the student).

Use of data in statistics 
Pearson has provided a large data set, which will support the assessment of Statistics in 
Paper 3: Statistics and Mechanics. Students are required to become familiar with the data 
set in advance of the final assessment. 
Assessments will be designed in such a way that questions assume knowledge and 
understanding of the data set. The expectation is that these questions should be likely to 
give a material advantage to students who have studied and are familiar with the data set. 
They might include questions/tasks that: 
● assume familiarity with the terminology and contexts of the data, and do not explain them 
in a way that gives students who have not studied the data set the same opportunities to 
access marks as students who have studied them 
● use summary statistics or selected data from, or statistical diagrams based on, the data 
set – these might be provided in the question or task, or as stimulus materials 
● are based on samples related to the contexts in the data set, where students’ work with 
the data set will help them understand the background context and/or 
● require students to interpret data in ways that would be too demanding in an unfamiliar 
context. 
Students will not be required to have copies of the data set in the examination, nor will they 
be required to have detailed knowledge of the actual data within the data set. 
The data set can be downloaded from our website, qualifications.pearson.com. This data set 
should be appropriate for the lifetime of the qualification. However we will review the data 
set on an annual basis to ensure it is appropriate. If we need to make changes to the data 
set, we will notify centres before the beginning of the two-year course before students 
complete their examination.

proof, proceeding from 
given assumptions 
through a series of logical 
steps to a conclusion; use 
methods of proof, 
including: Examples of proofs: 
Proof by deduction  
 
Proof by deduction 
e.g. using completion of the square, 
prove that n2 − 6n + 10 is positive for 
all values of n or, for example, 
differentiation from first principles for 
small positive integer powers of x or 
proving results for arithmetic and geometric 
series. This is the most commonly used 
method of proof throughout this 
specification 
Proof by exhaustion 
 
Proof by exhaustion 
Given that p is a prime number such 
that 3 < p < 25, prove by exhaustion, 
that (p – 1)(p + 1) is a multiple of 12. 
Disproof by counter 
example 
Disproof by counter example 
e.g. show that the statement 
“n2 – n + 1 is a prime number for all 
values of n” is untrue 
Proof by contradiction 
(including proof of the 
irrationality of 2  and the 
infinity of primes, and 
application to unfamiliar 
proofs).

am × an = am + n, am ÷ an = am − n, (am)n = amn 
The equivalence of
mna and n ma  should

The discriminant of a 
quadratic function, 
including the conditions

2.5 Solve linear and quadratic 
inequalities in a single 
variable and interpret such 
inequalities graphically, 
 
 
 
e.g. solving  
ax + b > cx + d,  
px2 + qx + r ≥ 0,    
px2 + qx + r < ax + b  
and interpreting the third inequality 
as the range of x for which the curve  
y = px2 + qx + r is below the line with 
equation y = ax + b 
including inequalities with 
brackets and fractions. 
These would be reducible to linear or 
quadratic inequalities  
e.g. 
x
a < b becomes ax < bx2 
Express solutions through 
correct use of ‘and’ and 
‘or’, or through set 
notation. 
So, e.g. x < a or x > b is equivalent to  
{ x : x < a } ∪ { x : x > b }  
and { x : c < x } ∩ { x : x < d } is 
equivalent to x > c and x < d 
Represent linear and 
quadratic inequalities such 
as y > x + 1 and 
y > ax2 + bx + c graphically. 
Shading and use of dotted and solid 
line convention is required. 
2.6 Manipulate polynomials 
algebraically, including 
expanding brackets and 
collecting like terms, 
factorisation and simple 
algebraic division; use of 
the factor theorem. 
Only division by (ax + b) or (ax – b) will 
be required.  
Students should know that if f(x) = 0  
when x = b
a
, then (ax – b) is a factor of  
f(x). 
Students may be required to factorise 
cubic expressions such as  
x3 + 3x2 – 4 and 6x3 + 11x2 – x – 6. 
Simplify rational expressions, 
including by factorising and 
cancelling, and algebraic 
division (by linear expressions 
only). 
Denominators of rational expressions will

Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our UK Information Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers and is 
available on our website: qualifications.pearson.com 
Discount code and performance tables 
Centres should be aware that students who enter for more than one GCE qualification with 
the same discount code will have only one of the grades they achieve counted for the 
purpose of the school and college performance tables. This will be the grade for the larger 
qualification (i.e. the A Level grade rather than the AS grade). If the qualifications are the 
same size, then the better grade will be counted (please see Appendix 8: Codes). 
Students should be advised that if they take two GCE qualifications with the same discount 
code, colleges, universities and employers which they wish to progress to are likely to take 
the view that this achievement is equivalent to only one GCE. The same view may be taken if 
students take two GCE qualifications that have different discount codes but have significant 
overlap of content. Students or their advisers who have any doubts about their subject 
combinations should check with the institution they wish to progress to before embarking on 
their programmes.  
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, 
special consideration and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
● students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
● all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will be available in English. All student work must be 
in English.

Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to: 
● access the assessment 
● show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment.  
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability, without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under the 
Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment.  
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable adjustments 
where a person with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in undertaking an 
assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps to overcome 
that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular person may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
including: 
● the needs of the student with the disability 
● the effectiveness of the adjustment 
● the cost of the adjustment; and 
● the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation, or affects timeframes or the security or integrity of the assessment. This is 
because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a student's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the examination/ 
assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material effect on a 
candidate’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate their level of attainment in  
an assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements 
and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
consideration, please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk.

Malpractice 
Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in examinations must be reported to Pearson using a JCQ Form M1 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form should be emailed to 
candidatemalpractice@pearson.com. Please provide as much information and supporting 
documentation as possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies 
with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice. 
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the 
integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on a  
JCQ Form M2(a) (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form, 
supporting documentation and as much information as possible should be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com. Note that the final decision regarding  
appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
General and Vocational Qualifications Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and 
Assessments Policies and Procedures, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice. 
Awarding and reporting 
This qualification will be graded, awarded and certificated to comply with the requirements of 
Ofqual's General Conditions of Recognition.

Appendix 3: Use of calculators 
Students may use a calculator in all A Level Mathematics examinations. Students are 
responsible for making sure that their calculators meet the guidelines set out in this 
appendix. 
The use of technology permeates the study of A Level Mathematics. Calculators used must 
include the following features: 
● an iterative function 
● the ability to compute summary statistics and access probabilities from standard statistical 
distributions. 
In addition, students must be told these regulations before sitting an examination: 
 
Calculators must be: 
● of a size suitable for use on 
the desk 
● either battery- or solar powered 
● free of lids, cases and covers that 
have printed instructions or 
formulas. 
Calculators must not: 
● be designed or adapted to offer any of these 
facilities 
o language translators 
o symbolic algebra manipulation 
o symbolic differentiation or integration 
o communication with other machines or 
the internet 
● be borrowed from another student during an 
examination for any reason* 
● have retrievable information stored in them – 
this includes 
o databanks 
o dictionaries 
o mathematical formulas 
o text. 
The student is responsible for 
the following: 
● the calculator’s power supply 
● the calculator’s working condition 
● clearing anything stored in the 
calculator. 
 
 
Advice: *an invigilator may give a student a replacement calculator.

Appendix 5: The context for the 
development of this qualification 
All our qualifications are designed to meet our World Class Qualification Principles[1] and our 
ambition to put the student at the heart of everything we do. 
We have developed and designed this qualification by: 
● reviewing other curricula and qualifications to ensure that it is comparable with those 
taken in high-performing jurisdictions overseas 
● consulting with key stakeholders on content and assessment, including learned bodies, 
subject associations, higher-education academics, teachers and employers to ensure this 
qualification is suitable for a UK context 
● reviewing the legacy qualification and building on its positive attributes. 
This qualification has also been developed to meet criteria stipulated by Ofqual in their 
documents GCE Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements and GCE Subject Level 
Conditions and Requirements for Mathematics, published in April 2016. 
                                                
 
[1] Pearson’s World Class Qualification Principles ensure that our qualifications are: 
● demanding, through internationally benchmarked standards, encouraging deep learning and 
measuring higher-order skills 
● rigorous, through setting and maintaining standards over time, developing reliable and valid 
assessment tasks and processes, and generating confidence in end users of the knowledge, skills 
and competencies of certified students

From Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class Qualifications 
May 2014 
“The reform of the qualifications system in England is a profoundly important change to the 
education system. Teachers need to know that the new qualifications will assist them in 
helping their learners make progress in their lives. 
When these changes were first proposed we were approached by Pearson to join an ‘Expert 
Panel’ that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. 
We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of 
our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe. 
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification development 
process that has included: 
● extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-performing 
jurisdictions in the world 
● benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they are at 
the right level of demand 
● establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications 
● subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual 
accreditation criteria in advance of submission.  
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented. The 
design has been guided by what is called an ‘Efficacy Framework’, meaning learner outcomes 
have been at the heart of this development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s 
success in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have 
supported the development of qualifications that are outstanding for their coherence, 
thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as representing world-class best 
practice.

Appendix 6: Transferable skills 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned and 
that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and can be 
built upon and extended through learning.’ 
[1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework as the most evidence-based and 
robust skills framework. We adapted the framework slightly to include the Program for 
International Student Assessment (PISA) ICT Literacy and Collaborative Problem Solving 
(CPS) Skills. 
The adapted National Research Council’s framework of skills involves: [2]  
Cognitive skills 
● Non-routine problem solving – expert thinking, metacognition, creativity. 
● Systems thinking – decision making and reasoning. 
● Critical thinking – definitions of critical thinking are broad and usually involve general 
cognitive skills such as analysing, synthesising and reasoning skills. 
● ICT literacy – access, manage, integrate, evaluate, construct and communicate. [3]  
Interpersonal skills 
● Communication – active listening, oral communication, written communication, assertive 
communication and non-verbal communication. 
● Relationship-building skills – teamwork, trust, intercultural sensitivity, service 
orientation, self-presentation, social influence, conflict resolution and negotiation. 
● Collaborative problem solving – establishing and maintaining shared understanding, 
taking appropriate action, establishing and maintaining team organisation. 
Intrapersonal skills 
● Adaptability – ability and willingness to cope with the uncertain, handling work stress, 
adapting to different personalities, communication styles and cultures, and physical 
adaptability to various indoor and outdoor work environments. 
● Self-management and self-development – ability to work remotely in virtual teams, 
work autonomously, be self-motivating and self-monitoring, willing and able to acquire 
new information and skills related to work. 
Transferable skills enable young people to face the demands of further and higher education, 
as well as the demands of the workplace, and are important in the teaching and learning of 
this qualification. We will provide teaching and learning materials, developed with 
stakeholders, to support our qualifications.

Appendix 7: Level 3 Extended Project 
qualification 
What is the Extended Project? 
The Extended Project is a standalone qualification that can be taken alongside GCEs. 
It supports the development of independent learning skills and helps to prepare students for 
their next step – whether that be higher education or employment. The qualification: 
● is recognised by higher education for the skills it develops 
● is worth half of an Advanced GCE qualification at grades A*–E 
● carries UCAS points for university entry. 
The Extended Project encourages students to develop skills in the following areas: research, 
critical thinking, extended writing and project management. Students identify and agree a 
topic area of their choice for in-depth study (which may or may not be related to a GCE 
subject they are already studying), guided by their teacher. 
Students can choose from one of four approaches to produce:  
● a dissertation (for example an investigation based on predominately secondary research) 
● an investigation/field study (for example a practical experiment) 
● a performance (for example in music, drama or sport) 
● an artefact (for example creating a sculpture in response to a client brief or solving an 
engineering problem). 
The qualification is coursework based and students are assessed on the skills of managing, 
planning and evaluating their project. Students will research their topic, develop skills to 
review and evaluate the information, and then present the final outcome of their project. 
The Extended Project has 120 guided learning hours (GLH) consisting of a 40-GLH taught 
element that includes teaching the technical skills (for example research skills) and an  
80-GLH guided element that includes mentoring students through the project work. 
The qualification is 100% internally assessed and externally moderated. 
How to link the Extended Project with mathematics 
The Extended Project creates the opportunity to develop transferable skills for progression to 
higher education and to the workplace, through the exploration of either an area of personal 
interest or a topic of interest from within the mathematics qualification content. 
Through the Extended Project, students can develop skills that support their study of 
mathematics, including: 
● conducting, organising and using research 
● independent reading in the subject area 
● planning, project management and time management 
● defining a hypothesis to be tested in investigations or developing a design brief 
● collecting, handling and interpreting data and evidence 
● evaluating arguments and processes, including arguments in favour of alternative 
interpretations of data and evaluation of experimental methodology 
● critical thinking. 
In the context of the Extended Project, critical thinking refers to the ability to identify and 
develop arguments for a point of view or hypothesis, and to consider and respond to 
alternative arguments.

Types of Extended Project related to mathematics 
Students may produce a dissertation on any topic that can be researched and argued. 
In mathematics this might involve working on a substantial statistical project or a project 
that requires the use of mathematical modelling. 
Projects can give students the opportunity to develop mathematical skills that cannot be 
adequately assessed in examination questions. 
● Statistics – students can have the opportunity to plan a statistical enquiry project, use 
different methods of sampling and data collection, use statistical software packages to 
process and investigate large quantities of data and review results to decide if more data 
is needed. 
● Mathematical modelling – students can have the opportunity to choose modelling 
assumptions, compare with experimental data to assess the appropriateness of their 
assumptions and refine their modelling assumptions until they get the required accuracy 
of results. 
Using the Extended Project to support breadth and depth 
In the Extended Project, students are assessed on the quality of the work they produce and 
the skills they develop and demonstrate through completing this work. Students should 
demonstrate that they have extended themselves in some significant way beyond what they 
have been studying in mathematics. Students can demonstrate extension in one or more 
dimensions: 
● deepening understanding – where a student explores a topic in greater depth than in 
the specification content. This could be an in-depth exploration of one of the topics in the 
specification 
● broadening skills – where a student learns a new skill. This might involve learning the 
skills in statistics or mathematical modelling mentioned above or learning a new 
mathematical process and its practical uses 
● widening perspectives – where the student’s project spans different subjects.  
Projects in a variety of subjects need to be supported by data and statistical analysis. 
Students studying mathematics with design and technology can carry out design projects 
involving the need to model a situation mathematically in planning their design. 
A wide range of information to support the delivery and assessment of the Extended Project, 
including the specification, teacher guidance for all aspects, an editable scheme of work and 
exemplars for all four approaches, can be found on our website.
