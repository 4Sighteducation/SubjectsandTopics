From Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class Qualifications 
May 2014 
“ The reform of the qualifications system in England is a profoundly important 
change to the education system. Teachers need to know that the new qualifications 
will assist them in helping their learners make progress in their lives. 
When these changes were first proposed we were approached by Pearson to join an 
‘Expert Panel’ that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. 
We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or 
because of our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the 
world as diverse as Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries 
across Europe. 
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification 
development process that has included: 
● extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest- 
performing jurisdictions in the world 
● benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they 
are at the right level of demand 
● establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject- 
specific expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications 
● subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual 
accreditation criteria in advance of submission. 
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future 
oriented. The design has been guided by what is called an ‘Efficacy Framework’, 
meaning learner outcomes have been at the heart of this development throughout. 
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a 
learner’s success in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident 
that we have supported the development of qualifications that are outstanding for 
their coherence, thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as 
representing world-class best practice.”

 Introduction  
 
The Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in English Literature is designed for use 
in schools and colleges. It is part of a suite of GCE qualifications offered by Pearson. 
 
Purpose of the specification 
 
This specification sets out: 
• the objectives of the qualification 
• any other qualification(s) that a student must have completed before taking the 
qualification 
• any prior knowledge and skills that the student is required to have before taking 
the qualification 
• any other requirements that a student must have satisfied before they will be 
assessed or before the qualification will be awarded 
• the knowledge and understanding that will be assessed as part of the 
qualification 
• the method of assessment and any associated requirements relating to it 
• the criteria against which a student’s level of attainment will be measured (such 
as assessment criteria). 
Rationale 
 
The Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in English Literature meets the 
following purposes, which fulfil those defined by the Office of Qualifications and 
Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) for Advanced GCE qualifications in their GCE 
Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements document, published in April 2014. 
The purposes of this qualification are to: 
● define and assess achievement of the knowledge, skills and understanding that 
will be needed by students planning to progress to undergraduate study at a UK 
higher education establishment, particularly (although not only) in the same 
subject area, for example English Literature 
● set out a robust and internationally comparable post-16 academic course of 
study to develop that knowledge, skills and understanding 
● enable UK universities to accurately identify the level of attainment of students 
● provide a basis for school and college accountability measures at age 18 
● provide a benchmark of academic ability for employers. 
 
Qualification aims and objectives 
The aims and objectives of the Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in English 
Literature are to enable students to: 
● read widely and independently set texts and others that they have selected for 
themselves 
● engage critically and creatively with a substantial body of texts and ways of 
responding to them 
● develop and effectively apply their knowledge of literary analysis and evaluation 
● explore the contexts of the texts they are reading and others’ interpretations of 
them 
● undertake independent and sustained studies to deepen their appreciation and 
understanding of English literature, including its changing traditions. 
 
The context for the development of this qualification 
All our qualifications are designed to meet our World Class Qualification Principles[1] 
and our ambition to put the student at the heart of everything we do. 
We have developed and designed this qualification by: 
● reviewing other curricula and qualifications to ensure that it is comparable with 
those taken in high-performing jurisdictions overseas 
● consulting with key stakeholders on content and assessment, including learned 
bodies, subject associations, higher-education academics, teachers and 
employers to ensure this qualification is suitable for a UK context 
● reviewing the legacy qualification and building on its positive attributes. 
This qualification has also been developed to meet criteria stipulated by Ofqual in 
their documents GCE Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements and GCE 
Subject Level Conditions and Requirements for English Literature, published in 
April 2014. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[1] Pearson’s World Class Qualification principles ensure that our qualifications are: 
● demanding, through internationally benchmarked standards, encouraging deep 
learning and measuring higher-order skills 
● rigorous, through setting and maintaining standards over time, developing 
reliable and valid assessment tasks and processes, and generating confidence in 
end users of the knowledge, skills and competencies of certified students 
● inclusive, through conceptualising learning as continuous, recognising that 
students develop at different rates and have different learning needs, and 
focusing on progression 
● empowering, through promoting the development of transferable skills,

Knowledge, skills and understanding 
 
 
Component 1: Drama 
 
 
Overview 
Students will study aspects of the form of drama via two plays. The central focus of 
the drama study is the literary text. Students will need to explore the use of literary 
and dramatic devices and the shaping of meanings in their chosen plays. Students 
study a tragedy or comedy drama by Shakespeare and another drama. 
Teaching and wider reading should address the significance and influence of 
contextual factors and engage with different interpretations of the chosen 
Shakespeare play. 
Students’ study of Shakespeare should be enhanced by engagement with critical 
writing. Teaching of this is supported by either Shakespeare: A Critical Anthology – 
Tragedy or Shakespeare: A Critical Anthology – Comedy, provided by Pearson free 
of charge. 
 
Learning outcomes 
Students are required to: 
● show knowledge and understanding of how playwrights use dramatic forms to 
shape meaning in drama texts and evoke responses in audiences 
● show knowledge and understanding of the contexts in which texts have been 
produced and received and understanding of how these contexts influence 
meaning 
● show knowledge and understanding of a range of ways to read and experience 
texts, responding critically and creatively 
● respond to and evaluate texts, drawing on their understanding of interpretations 
by different readers such as literary critics 
● identify and explore how attitudes and values are expressed in texts 
● communicate fluently, accurately and effectively their knowledge, understanding 
and evaluation of texts 
● use literary critical concepts and terminology with understanding and 
discrimination 
● make appropriate use of the conventions of writing in literary studies, referring 
accurately and appropriately to texts and sources.

Critical writing 
As part of their study of their selected Shakespeare play, students should engage 
with different interpretations. To support this, students should be provided with 
either the Shakespeare: A Critical Anthology: Tragedy or Shakespeare: A Critical 
Anthology: Comedy. Each critical anthology includes four generic essays and three 
specific essays on each set text to encourage students to engage with different 
readings of their studied Shakespeare play. 
Each anthology fulfils all of the requirements for engagement with different 
perspectives for this component. However, centres are welcome to select other 
essays or criticism on their studied Shakespeare play or to supplement the critical 
anthologies with other critical materials on Shakespeare’s drama.

Component 3: Poetry 
 
Overview 
Students will study a selection of poems from two published poetry texts. 
They will consider the concerns and choices of modern-day poets in a selection of 
contemporary poems. Students will apply their knowledge of poetic form, content 
and meaning, and develop their skills in comparing an unseen poem with an 
example of studied poetry. 
Students will also develop depth of knowledge about poetic style by studying a 
selection from the work of a single named poet, or a selection from within a literary 
period or movement. Literary study of the chosen set poems should be enhanced 
by study of the contexts in which they were written and received. 
 
Learning outcomes 
Students are required to: 
● show knowledge and understanding of the function of genre features and 
conventions in poetry 
● show knowledge and understanding of a range of ways to read texts, including 
reading for detail of how writers use and adapt language, form and structure in 
texts, responding critically and creatively 
● show knowledge and understanding of a range of literary texts and make 
connections and explore the relationships between texts 
● show knowledge and understanding of the ways texts can be grouped and 
compared to inform interpretation 
● show knowledge and understanding of the contexts in which texts have been 
produced and received and understanding of how these contexts influence 
meaning 
● communicate fluently, accurately and effectively their knowledge, understanding 
and critical evaluation of texts 
● identify and explore how attitudes and values are expressed in texts 
● use literary critical concepts and terminology with understanding and 
discrimination 
● make appropriate use of the conventions of writing in literary studies referring 
accurately and appropriately to texts and sources.

Non-examination assessment 
 
Overview 
Non-examination assessment will be assessed via two texts. There are no 
prescribed texts but centres must select complete texts which may be drawn from 
poetry, drama, prose or literary non-fiction. Students must select different texts 
from those studied in Components 1, 2 and 3. 
The selected texts may be linked by theme, movement, author or period. Literary 
study of both texts should be enhanced by study of the links and connections 
between them, different interpretations and the contexts in which they were written 
and received. 
 
Learning outcomes 
Students are required to: 
● show knowledge and understanding of a variety of strategies for reading texts, 
including reading for detail of how writers use and adapt language, form and 
structure in texts 
● show knowledge and understanding of ways to interpret and evaluate texts 
independently and in response to interpretations by different readers 
● show knowledge and understanding of the contexts in which texts have been 
produced and received and understanding of how these contexts influence 
meaning 
● show knowledge and understanding of a range of literary texts and make 
connections and explore the relationships between texts 
● show knowledge and understanding of the ways texts can be grouped and 
linked to inform interpretation 
● identify and explore how attitudes and values are expressed in texts 
● communicate fluently, accurately and effectively their knowledge, understanding 
and evaluation of texts 
● use literary critical concepts and terminology with understanding and 
discrimination 
● make appropriate use of the conventions of writing in literary studies, referring 
accurately and appropriately to texts and sources 
● make connections and explore the relationships between texts.

Assignment setting, taking and marking 
 
Assignment setting 
When deciding on the texts they select and the assignments 
they produce, students should be encouraged to draw on 
their own interests and skills, as well as applying what they 
have learned about literature. The choice of texts should be 
made with teacher guidance to ensure that they are of an 
appropriate standard. 
Teachers are encouraged to use the assignment guidance 
service offered by Pearson to check the appropriate nature 
of assignments selected by students. 
It is advised that, due to the personal nature of the 
assignment selection each year, students complete different 
assignments from previous years. 
Centres are advised that Pearson will carry out checks on 
their adherence to the requirement that texts studied for an 
examination are not used in non-examination assessment 
and that at least three pre-1900 texts have been studied 
overall. 
 
Assignment use 
Teachers should ensure that texts chosen by students are 
relevant and appropriate to the student’s course of learning. 
Students should have the opportunity to choose 
sources/interpretations/texts as appropriate. 
 
Assignment guidance service 
Pearson provides a free assignment guidance service. 
Please see our website qualifications.pearson.com for 
further details. 
 
Assignment research 
 
Teaching and learning 
Teachers should provide students with a short course of 
study that covers: 
● research and study skills 
● editing and proofreading skills 
● referencing and bibliography skills. 
 
Collaboration 
Students may work together on their research. 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in English Literature 
Specification – Issue 11 – August 2025 © Pearson Education Limited 2025 
23  
Feedback 
Teachers may help students to understand rubrics, 
assessment criteria and controls. Teachers must not give 
students solutions. For example, teachers may provide a 
simplified student friendly version of the assessment 
criteria, but this must not be specific to the work of 
individual students or a group of students (see the Joint 
Council for Qualifications (JCQ) Instructions for conducting 
non-examination assessments (new GCE and GCSE 
specifications) on the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk). Any 
additional feedback must be recorded in the Non- 
examination assessment authentication sheet (see 
Appendix 4). 
 
Resources 
Students must have equal access to IT resources. They 
should have access to a range of resources, interpretations 
and texts to enable them to make choices as required for 
their assignments. 
 
Assignment writing 
 
Authenticity 
Students and teachers must sign the Non-examination 
assessment authentication sheet (see Appendix 4). 
Teachers must review at least one draft to offer support 
and to ensure they can verify that the student’s final work 
is their own. This support may take the form of general 
advice only and work may not be provisionally assessed. 
Please refer to the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) 
Instructions for conducting non-examination assessments 
(new GCE and GCSE specifications) on the JCQ website: 
www.jcq.org.uk) for further information on the level of 
feedback permitted. 
Students must ensure that all quotations and citations are 
referenced using an established referencing system, such as 
Harvard, and produce a bibliography citing reference texts. 
 
Collaboration 
Students must not work with others when writing their 
assignments. Centres must ensure that the same teacher 
has reviewed all work from a class in order to be able to 
verify on the Non-examination assessment authentication 
sheet that students’ work is their own.

Feedback 
Teachers may help students to understand rubrics, 
assessment criteria and controls. Any additional feedback 
must be recorded on the Non-examination assessment 
authentication sheet (see Appendix 4). Please refer to the

Word count 
It is strongly recommended that students write between 
2500–3000 words in total for their chosen assignment. This 
does not include footnotes and bibliographies. 
It is advisable that the upper word limit is adhered to by 
students to enable them to satisfy the requirement to 
produce a concise and coherently structured response. 
 
Assignment marking 
Teachers should mark the assignment using the assessment 
criteria on the following pages. Teachers may annotate 
students’ work. The marks awarded should be justified and 
teachers should add comments to the Non-examination 
assessment authentication sheet (see Appendix 4). 
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in English Literature 
Specification – Issue 11 – August 2025 © Pearson Education Limited 2025 
25  
Assessment criteria 
Teachers must mark students’ work using the assessment criteria on pages 26–28. 
 
Marking guidance 
● All candidates must receive the same treatment. Teachers must mark the last 
candidate in exactly the same way as they mark the first. 
● Mark schemes should be applied positively. Candidates must be rewarded for 
what they have shown they can do rather than be penalised for omissions. 
● All the marks on the mark scheme are designed to be awarded. Teachers should 
always award full marks if deserved, i.e. if the answer matches the mark 
scheme. Teachers should be prepared to award zero marks if the candidate’s 
response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme. 
The marking grids have been designed to assess student work holistically. The grids 
identify which Assessment Objective is being targeted by each bullet point within 
the level descriptors. Each bullet point is linked to one Assessment Objective, 
however please note that the number of bullet points in the level descriptor does 
not directly correlate to the number of marks in the level descriptor. 
When deciding how to reward an answer using a levels-based mark scheme, the 
‘best fit’ approach should be used. To do this teachers should: 
● first decide which level descriptor most closely matches the candidate answer 
and place it in that band 
● decide on the mark awarded within the band based on the quality of the answer 
and modify according to how securely all bullet point descriptors are met at that 
level 
● remember that in cases of uneven performance, all the above points still apply. 
Candidates are to be placed in the band that best describes their answer 
according to each of the Assessment Objectives described in the level. Marks 
will be awarded towards the top or bottom of that band depending how they 
have evidenced each of the descriptor bullet points 
● remember that all Assessment Objectives within a level are equally weighted 
and they must take this into consideration when making their judgements. 
 
Please refer to the marking guidance on page 25 when applying this grid.

Marking, standardisation and moderation 
The assignment is marked by teachers. Where marking for 
this qualification has been carried out by more than one 
teacher in a centre, a process of internal standardisation 
must be carried out to ensure that there is a consistent 
application of the assessment criteria. 
Marks awarded by the centre will be subject to external 
moderation by Pearson. Moderation will ensure consistency 
with national standards and will review assignments to 
ensure that the assignment setting rules have been 
correctly applied by centres. Pearson will notify centres of 
the students whose responses have been selected for 
moderation. This sample will take cohort size into account. 
If the moderation indicates that centre assessment does not 
reflect national standards, an adjustment will be made to 
students’ final marks to compensate. 
Please refer to the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) 
Instructions for conducting non-examination assessments 
(new GCE and GCSE specifications) on the JCQ website, 
www.jcq.org.uk, for further information. The assessment in 
this qualification will comply with these instructions. 
 
Security and backups 
 
It is the responsibility of the centre to keep the work that 
students have submitted for assessment secure. 
Secure storage is defined as a securely locked cabinet or 
cupboard.

have only one of the grades they achieve counted for the 
purpose of the School and College Performance Tables. If 
the qualifications are the same size, then the better grade 
will be counted (please see Appendix 3: Codes). 
Students should be advised that if they take two GCE 
qualifications with the same discount code, colleges, 
universities and employers are very likely to take the view 
that this achievement is equivalent to only one GCE. The 
same view may be taken if students take two GCE 
qualifications that have different discount codes but have 
significant overlap of content. Students or their advisers 
who have any doubts about their subject combinations 
should check with the institution to which they wish to 
progress before embarking on their programmes. 
 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and 
special consideration 
 
Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. 
They allow students with special educational needs, 
disabilities or temporary injuries to: 
● access the assessment 
● show what they know and can do without changing the 
demands of the assessment. 
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the 
particular needs of an individual student with a disability 
without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding 
36 Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in English Literature 
Specification – Issue 11 – August 2025 © Pearson Education Limited 2025 
 
bodies comply with the duty under the Equality Act 2010 to 
make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the 
start of the course. Students will then know what is 
available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for 
assessment. 
 
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to 
make reasonable adjustments where a person with a 
disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in 
undertaking an assessment. The awarding organisation is 
required to take reasonable steps to overcome that 
disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular person may be 
unique to that individual and therefore might not be in the 
list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will 
depend on a number of factors, which will include: 
● the needs of the student with the disability 
● the effectiveness of the adjustment 
● the cost of the adjustment; and 
● the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with 
the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves 
unreasonable costs to the awarding organisation, 
timeframes or affects the security or integrity of the 
assessment. This is because the adjustment is not 
‘reasonable’. 
 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a 
student's mark or grade to reflect temporary injury, illness 
or other indisposition at the time of the 
examination/assessment, which has had, or is reasonably 
likely to have had, a material effect on a candidate’s ability 
to take an assessment or demonstrate his or her level of 
attainment in an assessment.

apply for access arrangements and special consideration.

Malpractice 
 
Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of 
assessment or which undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in controlled assessments discovered 
before the candidate has signed the declaration of 
authentication form does not need to be reported to 
Pearson. 
Candidate malpractice found in controlled assessments after 
the declaration of authenticity has been signed, and in 
examinations must be reported to Pearson on a JCQ 
Form M1 (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams- 
office/malpractice). The form should be emailed to 
candidatemalpractice@pearson.com. Please provide as 
much information and supporting documentation as 
possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate 
sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report candidate malpractice constitutes staff or 
centre malpractice. 
 
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate 
malpractice and maladministration of our qualifications. As 
with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is 
any act that compromises or seeks to compromise the 
process of assessment or undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and 
maladministration must be reported immediately, before 
any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson 
on a JCQ Form M2(a) (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams- 
office/malpractice). The form, supporting documentation 
and as much information as possible should be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com. Note that the final decision 
regarding appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the 
latest version of the document General and Vocational 
Qualifications Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and 
Assessments Policies and Procedures, available at 
www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice.

Equality Act 2010 and Pearson equality policy 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality 
policy requires all students to have equal opportunity to 
access our qualifications and assessments, and our 
qualifications to be awarded in a way that is fair to every 
student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
● students with a protected characteristic (as defined by 
the Equality Act 2010) are not, when they are 
undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in 
comparison to students who do not share that 
characteristic 
● all students achieve the recognition they deserve for 
undertaking a qualification and that this achievement 
can be compared fairly to the achievement of their 
peers. 
You can find details on how to make adjustments for 
students with protected characteristics in the policy 
document Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments 
and Special Consideration which is on our website 
(qualifications.pearson.com). 
 
Synoptic assessment 
Synoptic assessment requires students to work across 
different parts of a qualification and to show their 
accumulated knowledge and understanding of a topic or 
subject area. 
Synoptic assessment enables students to show their ability 
to combine their skills, knowledge and understanding with 
breadth and depth of the subject. 
Students draw together skills synoptically in their analysis 
and evaluation of texts. This occurs throughout the 
qualification and assessment, particularly in the non- 
examination assessment.

Student recruitment 
 
Pearson follows the JCQ policy concerning recruitment to 
our qualifications in that: 
● they must be available to anyone who is capable of 
reaching the required standard 
● they must be free from barriers that restrict access and 
progression 
● equal opportunities exist for all students. 
 
Prior learning and other requirements 
 
There are no prior learning or other requirements for this 
qualification. 
Students who would benefit most from studying an 
Advanced GCE in English Literature are likely to have a 
Level 2 qualification such as a GCSE in English Literature. 
 
Progression 
 
Students can progress from this qualification to: 
● higher education courses such as degrees in English, 
English literature, creative writing or in related subjects 
such as journalism, media, teaching, drama, history 
● a wide range of careers directly related to English 
literature, such as teacher, editor, writer, or in areas 
such as publishing, journalism, the media, advertising, 
marketing, public relations, arts administration, record 
offices, libraries, national and local government and the 
civil service. 
 
Relationship between Advanced Subsidiary GCE and 
Advanced GCE 
The Advanced Subsidiary GCE is a discrete linear 
qualification and comprises two examined components; 
these are built from content that is common with the 
Advanced GCE but they have different assessments that 
take place at the end of the course.

The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently 
flagged the need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable 
them to respond with confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the 
world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines 
skills, or competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that 
can be learned and that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform 
an activity or task and can be built upon and extended through learning.’1 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected 
and evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this 
process, we identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework as the 
most evidence-based and robust skills framework. We adapted the framework 
slightly to include the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) ICT 
Literacy and Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) Skills. 
The adapted National Research Council’s framework of skills involves:2 
 
Cognitive skills 
● Non-routine problem solving – expert thinking, metacognition, creativity. 
● Systems thinking – decision making and reasoning. 
● Critical thinking – definitions of critical thinking are broad and usually involve 
general cognitive skills such as analysing, synthesising and reasoning skills.  
● ICT literacy – access, manage, integrate, evaluate, construct and 
communicate3. 
 
Interpersonal skills 
● Communication – active listening, oral communication, written 
communication, assertive communication and non-verbal communication. 
● Relationship-building skills – teamwork, trust, intercultural sensitivity, 
service orientation, self-presentation, social influence, conflict resolution and 
negotiation. 
● Collaborative problem solving – establishing and maintaining shared 
understanding, taking appropriate action, establishing and maintaining team 
organisation.

Intrapersonal skills 
● Adaptability – ability and willingness to cope with the uncertain, handling work 
stress, adapting to different personalities, communication styles and cultures, 
and physical adaptability to various indoor and outdoor work environments.  
● Self-management and self-development – ability to work remotely in virtual 
teams, work autonomously, be self-motivating and self-monitoring, willing and 
able to acquire new information and skills related to work. 
Transferable skills enable young people to face the demands of further and higher 
education, as well as the demands of the workplace, and are important in the 
teaching and learning of this qualification. We will provide teaching and learning 
materials, developed with stakeholders, to support our qualifications.

What is the Extended Project? 
The Extended Project is a standalone qualification that can be taken alongside 
GCEs. It supports the development of independent learning skills and helps to 
prepare students for their next step – whether that be higher education study or 
employment. The qualification: 
● is recognised by higher education for the skills it develops 
● is worth half of an Advanced GCE qualification at grades A*–E 
● carries UCAS points for university entry. 
The Extended Project encourages students to develop skills in the following areas: 
research, critical thinking, extended writing and project management. Students 
identify and agree a topic area of their choice (which may or may not be related to 
a GCE subject they are already studying), guided by their teacher. 
Students can choose from one of four approaches to produce: 
● a dissertation (for example, an investigation based on predominately secondary 
research) 
● an investigation/field study (for example, a practical experiment) 
● a performance (for example, in music, drama or sport) 
● an artefact (for example, creating a sculpture in response to a client brief or 
solving an engineering problem). 
The qualification is non-examination assessment based and students are assessed 
on the skills of managing, planning and evaluating their project. Students will 
research their topic, develop skills to review and evaluate the information, and then 
present the final outcome of their project. 
 
Students: what they need to do 
The Extended Project qualification requires students to: 
● select a topic of interest for an in-depth study and negotiate the scope of the 
project with their teacher 
● identify and draft an objective for their project (for example, in the form of a 
question, hypothesis, challenge, outline of proposed performance, issue to be 
investigated or commission for a client) and provide a rationale for their choice 
● produce a plan for how they will deliver their intended objective 
● conduct research as required by the project brief, using appropriate techniques 
● carry out the project using tools and techniques safely 
● share the outcome of the project using appropriate communication methods, 
including a presentation. 
Appendix 2: Level 3 Extended Project 
qualification 
46 Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in English Literature 
Specification – Issue 11 – August 2025 © Pearson Education Limited 2025  
Teachers: key information 
● The Extended Project has 120 guided learning hours (GLH) consisting of: 
o a taught 40-GLH element that includes teaching the technical skills 
(for example, research skills) 
o a guided 80-GLH element that includes mentoring students through the 
project work. 
● Group work is acceptable, however it is important that each student provides 
evidence of their own contribution and produces their own report. 
● 100% externally moderated. 
● Four Assessment Objectives: manage, use resources, develop and realise, 
review. 
● Can be run over 1, 1½ or 2 years. 
● Can be submitted in January or June. 
 
How to link the Extended Project with English Literature 
The Extended Project creates the opportunity to develop transferable skills for 
progression to higher education and the workplace. This is through the exploration 
of an area of personal interest or a topic of interest from the English Literature 
qualification content. For example, English Literature students could work on a 
dissertation that explores an aspect of English literature. 
 
Skills developed 
Through what they are taught and from their work on other projects, it is expected 
that Extended Project students will develop skills in the following areas: 
● independent research skills, including skills in primary research and the 
selection of appropriate methods for data collection 
● extended reading and academic writing, including reading academic articles 
● planning/project management, including the refining of research questions 
● source handling and evaluation 
● evaluation of arguments and processes, including arguments in favour of 
alternative interpretations of sources and evaluation of the research process 
● critical thinking. 
In the context of the Extended Project, critical thinking refers to the ability to 
identify and develop arguments for a point of view or hypothesis, and the ability to 
consider and to respond to alternative arguments. 
The Extended Project is an ideal vehicle to develop the transferable skills identified 
in Appendix 1.

Using the Extended Project to support breadth and depth 
Students are not expected to study specified material. In the Extended Project, 
students are assessed on the quality of the work they produce and the skills they 
develop and demonstrate through working on it. 
English Literature students should demonstrate that they have extended 
themselves in some significant way by means of their Extended Project. It is 
important that they show at the outset how their work involves significant 
extension beyond what they have studied in English Literature. Students can use 
the Extended Project to demonstrate extension in one or more dimensions: 
● deepening understanding: this is where a student explores a topic in greater 
depth than in the specification content. An English Literature student could 
choose to carry out a deeper, more analytic exploration of a concept that can be 
explored through the lens of textual study. For example, questions about the 
nature of literature or exploration of a concept such as identity or meaning 
● broadening skills: this is where a student learns a new skill, for example 
performance skills 
● widening perspectives: this is where a student’s project spans different 
subjects and involves cross-curricular exploration that looks at, for example, 
political, social, philosophical and psychological aspects of the question.  
 
Choosing topics and narrowing down to a question 
Topics or titles linked to the themes from the English Literature qualification could 
inspire a choice of Extended Project topic. 
As an example of an English Literature related project, consider a student who, 
having studied Hamlet, decided to explore the question of how identity is defined, 
using the text of the play as a central source. The student’s dissertation contained a 
literature review, examining the way in which the concept of identity figures in 
Hamlet, and exploring this through engagement with commentaries on the play. In 
the discussion section, the student critically examined some philosophical aspects of 
the question of identity, using points from Hamlet to exemplify them. The project 
concluded with a review of the research process and an oral presentation of the 
main findings. 
Examples of dissertation titles: 
● Does the work of Christopher Marlowe illustrate the idea that works of art reflect 
rather than initiate social changes? 
● Is it possible to produce tragedy in the modern era? 
● Is poetry essential to religious literature? 
● Is authorial intent irrelevant when we are seeking to interpret a text? 
There is also scope for English Literature based performance and artefact Extended 
Projects. For example, a student might perform scenes from a text they are 
studying or create an artefact inspired by a topic studied in English Literature.
