# Patterns for matching different elements
patterns:
  theme: '^Theme\s+([A-E]):\s*'  # "Theme A:", "Theme B:", etc.
  section: '^([A-Z].+?\?)\s*$'  # Questions ending with ? (e.g., "What is identity?")
  topic: '^(\d+)\s+(.+)$'  # Numbered topics (e.g., "1 The changing UK population")
  bullet: '^[●•]\s+'  # Bullet points

# Patterns to skip (avoid duplicates)
skip_patterns:
  - 'Key questions explored:'  # Skip the intro bullets
  - '^●\s+(What|How|Does|Who|Is)'  # Skip bullet-prefixed questions (they appear later as actual sections)
  - 'Subject content'
  - 'Students should'
  - 'Pearson Edexcel'
  - '© Pearson'
