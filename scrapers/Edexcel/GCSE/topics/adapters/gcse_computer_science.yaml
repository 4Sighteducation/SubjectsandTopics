# Heading anchor patterns (regex)
# These match specific heading types in the PDF
anchors:
  H0: "^Paper\\s+[12]:"  # "Paper 1:", "Paper 2:"
  H1: "^Topic\\s+[1-6]:"  # "Topic 1:", "Topic 2:", etc.
  H2: "^\\d+\\.\\d+\\s+[A-Z]"  # "1.1 Decomposition", "2.3 Data storage"
  H3: "^\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\s+"  # "1.1.1 understand...", "2.1.1 be able to..."

# Font size thresholds (used if anchor patterns don't match)
font_sizes:
  H0: 14.0  # Size 14 bold = Papers
  H1: 11.0  # Size 11 bold = Topics
  H2: 9.0   # Size 9 bold = Subtopics
  H3: 9.0   # Size 9 regular (non-bold) = Learning outcomes
