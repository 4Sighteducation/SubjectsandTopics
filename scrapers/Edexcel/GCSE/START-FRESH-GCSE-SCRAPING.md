# GCSE Fresh Start - Applying A-Level Lessons

## What Went Wrong:
- Basic pattern matching (just grabbed section numbers)
- Severe truncation (titles cut off)
- No table parsing
- Didn't exclude non-examined components
- Didn't use proven Business scraper approach

## What We'll Do Now:

### **Strategy 1: Use Proven A-Level Templates**

**Table-based subjects** (Geography, Business, Psychology, etc.):
→ Use `scrape-business-improved.py` template
→ Handles multi-column tables
→ Extracts full content
→ Builds 4-5 level hierarchies

**Science subjects** (Science, Astronomy):
→ Use `scrape-edexcel-universal.py` template  
→ Handles "Topic X:" pattern

**Languages** (14 languages):
→ Use A-Level language manual upload templates
→ Copy structure, adapt for GCSE themes

**Drama/Arts**:
→ Manual upload (only examined components)
→ Focus on Component 3 for Drama GCSE

### **Strategy 2: Subject-by-Subject Approach**

Rather than overnight batch, let's do:
1. **Quick wins** (5 subjects) - Use proven scrapers
2. **Table subjects** (10 subjects) - Business template
3. **Languages** (14 subjects) - Manual/templates
4. **Specialist** (6 subjects) - Manual

**Estimated time: 2-3 hours for all 35 GCSE subjects**

## Next Steps:

Let me create adapted scrapers for:
1. GCSE Business (test Business template)
2. GCSE Geography A/B (table-based)
3. GCSE Science (science pattern)
4. GCSE Drama (manual - Component 3 only)
5. Then batch process the rest
