1 Introduction 
Why choose Edexcel GCSE Statistics? 
We have listened to feedback from all parts of the mathematics and statistics subject 
community, including users of statistics within higher education and students of GCSE 
Statistics. We have used this opportunity of curriculum change to redesign a qualification 
which will enable your students to acquire transferable skills to support them in progressing 
beyond GCSE in a range of subjects. At the same time, this qualification retains many 
familiar features which have contributed to the popularity of our GCSE Statistics. 
Straightforward assessment structure – we have designed our qualification with two 
papers of equal size and weighting. This assessment structure supports a wide range of 
delivery models so you can continue to teach GCSE Statistics in the way that suits you. With 
the assessment objectives targeted equally in both papers, the statistical enquiry cycle 
assessment is integrated with the statistical methods supporting an integrated approach to 
statistics teaching, learning and exam preparation. 
Development of transferable skills – students are introduced to the skills of statistical 
enquiry, and practise the underpinning statistical calculations and interpretation using real 
world data and authentic contexts. Our approach supports skills development for progression 
to a range of subjects and develops an awareness of statistics beyond the classroom.  
Clear course content and approach – we have organised the content in a way that will be 
familiar, making it easy for you to find what you need in the specification, while the inclusion 
of guidance alongside the content statements gives clarity of coverage and unambiguous 
meaning.  
Clear, accessible question papers – our questions use the clear approach and design that 
you are familiar with. Careful ramping – within questions, across papers and between the 
tiers – together with the use of engaging real-life statistical material, support students of a 
range of abilities to achieve their potential, including enabling the strongest to demonstrate 
what they can do. 
Comprehensive support – change is easier with the right support, so we will be on hand to 
listen and give advice on the changes. We offer extensive help to plan your programme, 
teach the new content, track your students’ progress and assess their readiness for the final 
exam. We will provide the best support for flexible delivery so you have what you need to 
implement the new GCSE Statistics in a way that works for you.

2 Subject content 
The Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) in Statistics ensures that students develop 
the confidence and competence with statistical techniques to enable them to apply those 
techniques flexibly to solve statistical problems through a practical programme of study, with 
the expectation that: 
● all students (both tiers) will develop confidence and competence with the content 
identified by the standard type 
● all students will be assessed on the content identified by the standard type and the 
underlined type, and this content will be in both foundation tier and higher tier papers. 
The more highly-attaining students will develop confidence and competence with all this 
content 
● only the more highly-attaining students (Higher tier only) will be assessed on the content 
identified by bold type; the highest-attaining students will develop confidence and 
competence with this content 
● the distinction between standard, underlined and bold type applies to the content 
statements only, and not to assessment objectives or to the mathematical formulae in 
Appendix 1 
● all students will develop an appreciation that different approaches, including the use of 
technology, may be appropriate at each stage of the statistical enquiry cycle, and that 
statistical conclusions are developed through an iterative process of retesting and 
refinement 
● all students have the opportunity to apply statistical techniques within the framework of 
the statistical enquiry cycle using real data from authentic contexts. 
Please see Appendix 3 for details of formulae in both GCSE Mathematics and Statistics which 
will not be given in the assessments, and Appendix 2 for details of prior knowledge.  
Qualification aims and objectives 
The aims and objectives of this qualification are to enable students to develop statistical 
fluency and understanding through: 
● the use of statistical techniques in a variety of authentic investigations, using real-world 
data in contexts such as, but not limited to, populations, climate, sales etc. 
● identifying trends through carrying out appropriate calculations and data visualisation 
techniques 
● the application of statistical techniques across the curriculum, in subjects such as the 
sciences, social sciences, computing, geography, business and economics, and outside the 
classroom in the world in general 
● critically evaluating data, calculations and evaluations that would be commonly 
encountered in their studies and in everyday life 
● understanding how technology has enabled the collection, visualisation and analysis of 
large quantities of data to inform decision-making processes in public, commercial and 
academic sectors, including how technology can be used to generate diagrams and 
visualisations to represent data 
● understand ways that data can be organised, processed and presented, including 
statistical measures to compare data, understanding the advantages of using technology 
to automate processing 
● applying appropriate mathematical and statistical formulae, and building on prior 
knowledge.

Statistical enquiry cycle 
The order of the content, for each tier, follows the order of the statistical enquiry cycle. It 
is important that practical investigations are part of a programme of study so that students 
have the opportunity to understand that different approaches, including the use of 
technology, may be appropriate at each stage of the statistical enquiry cycle, and that 
statistical conclusions are developed through an iterative process of testing and refinement. 
1. Through using the statistical enquiry cycle students need to understand the importance 
of initial planning when designing a line of enquiry or investigation, including: 
● defining a question or hypothesis (or hypotheses) to investigate 
● deciding what data to collect and how to collect and record it giving reasons 
● developing a strategy for how to process and represent data giving reasons. 
2. Through using the statistical enquiry cycle students need to be able to recognise the 
constraints involved in sourcing appropriate data, including: 
● when designing collection methods for primary data 
● when researching sources for secondary data, including from reference publications, 
the internet and the media 
● through appreciating the importance of acknowledging sources 
● by recognising where issues of sensitivity may influence data availability. 
3. Through using the statistical enquiry cycle students need to understand ways that data 
can be processed and presented, including: 
● organising and processing data, including an understanding of how technology can 
be used 
● generating diagrams and visualisations to represent the data, including an 
understanding of outputs generated by appropriate technology 
● generating statistical measures to compare data, understanding the advantages of 
using technology to automate processing. 
4. Through using the statistical enquiry cycle students need to understand that results 
must be interpreted with reference to the context of the problem, including: 
● analysing/interpreting the diagrams and calculations/measures 
● reaching conclusions that relate to the questions and hypotheses addressed 
● making inferences and/or predictions 
● discussing the reliability of findings. 
5. Through using the statistical enquiry cycle students should show an understanding of the 
importance of clear and concise communication of findings and key ideas, and an 
awareness of target audience. They should also understand the importance of 
evaluating statistical work, including: 
● identifying weaknesses in approach or representation 
● suggesting improvements to processes or the presentation 
● refining the processes to elicit further clarification of the initial hypothesis.  
 
Any given question may assess one stage of the statistical enquiry cycle or more than one 
stage of the statistical enquiry cycle. For example, please see the Pearson Edexcel 
Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) in Statistics Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) document – 
Foundation Paper 1 Question 11 and Higher Paper 1 Question 2.

Foundation tier content 
A variety of contexts, including real-life data, will be used. (No detailed knowledge of those contexts will be expected.) Each item of content has a code, for 
example 1a.01, where 1 is ‘The collection of data’, a is ‘Planning’ and 01 is the numerical order of the content item. 
What students need to learn: Guidance 
1. The collection of data 
(a) Planning 
1a.01 Know that a hypothesis can be tested only through the appropriate 
collection and analysis of data. 
Formal use of null hypothesis will not be required. 
Specifying a hypothesis is expected, e.g. a hypothesis such as ‘as motor 
cycles get older their value is likely to go down’. 
1a.02 Know the constraints that may be faced in designing an investigation 
to test a hypothesis including factors such as time, costs, ethical 
issues, confidentiality, convenience. 
Give examples of these factors, e.g. salaries or difficulties in finding data. 
1a.03 Determine proactive strategies to mitigate issues that might arise 
during the statistical enquiry process. 
For example, dealing with difficulties in identifying the population,  
non-response issues or unexpected outcomes. 
(b) Types of data 
1b.01 Know and apply terms used to describe different types of data that can 
be collected for statistical analysis: raw data, quantitative, qualitative, 
categorical, ordinal, discrete, continuous, ungrouped, grouped, 
bivariate. 
Use of correct statistical terminology to describe given data is expected. 
Know that more than one term may be appropriate. 
Identification of variables relevant to an investigation or hypothesis is 
expected. 
1b.02 Know the advantages and implications of merging data into more 
general categories, and of grouping numerical data into class intervals. 
Expected to know class width, and implications of grouping data, 
e.g. loss of accuracy in both calculations and presentations. 
1b.03 Know and apply the terms explanatory (independent) variables and 
response (dependent) variables. 
Know that on a scatter diagram the explanatory (independent) variable 
should be on the ‘x’ axis. 
1b.04 Know the difference between primary and secondary data. Including advantages and disadvantages of each. 
Consideration of the reliability and accuracy of the data (including issues 
of rounding) and the recognition of possible constraints in accessing the 
data is expected.

What students need to learn: Guidance 
(c) Population and sampling 
1c.01 Know the difference between population, sample frame and sample. Identify a population, and suggest a suitable sampling frame. 
1c.02 Know that ‘population’ can have different meanings within a stated 
context. 
For example, all employees in an office; all females in the UK; all items 
produced in a factory. 
1c.03 Know reasons for employing judgement sampling or opportunity 
(convenience) sampling, and the associated risks of bias when these 
techniques are used. 
Including use of cluster sampling and quota sampling. Reasons, including 
factors such as convenience, cost and time. 
1c.04 Know appropriate sampling techniques in the context of the problem to 
avoid bias. 
Understand random, systematic, and quota sampling. 
Including advantages and disadvantages of each technique. 
e.g. Know that systematic and quota sampling techniques are generally 
non-random. Know that the period of systematic sampling may coincide 
with a period occurring in the data. 
1c.05 Know the key features of a simple random sample and demonstrate 
understanding of how different techniques, both physical and 
electronic, are used to select random members from a population: 
including, but not limited to, dice, cards, random number lists, and 
calculator functions. 
Be aware that all items in the population should have the same likelihood 
of inclusion in a simple random sample. 
Selection of items for a sample may be required, including dealing with 
issues such as repeated random numbers and random numbers out of 
range. 
1c.06 Use stratification and know when this is appropriate before sampling 
takes place. 
Identify suitable strata, e.g. gender or age group. 
Including the calculation of appropriate strata sizes. Stratifying by one 
category. 
(d) Collecting data 
1d.01 a. Know that data can be collected from different sources: 
experimental (laboratory, field and natural), simulation, 
questionnaires, observation, reference, census, population and 
sampling. 
b. Know that sources of secondary data should be acknowledged. 
The design of data collection sheets is expected. 
Simulations may include use of random numbers. 
1d.02 Know the importance of reliability and validity with regard 
to collected data. 
Reliability is the extent to which repeated measurements yield similar 
results. 
Validity is the extent to which a test measures what was intended.

What students need to learn: Guidance 
(d) Collecting data continued 
1d.03 Determine factors that may lead to bias, including issues of sensitivity 
of the content matter, and know how to minimise data distortion. 
 
1d.04 Know the key features to be considered when planning data collection: 
leading questions, avoiding biased sources, time factors, open/closed 
questions, different types of interview technique. 
The design of suitable questions and data collection sheets is expected. 
Awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of data collection 
techniques. 
The rationale behind pilots for questionnaires and pre-tests for 
experiments should be known. 
1d.05 Know and demonstrate understanding of techniques used to deal with 
problems that may arise with collected data. 
For example missing data, incorrect formats, non-responses, incomplete 
responses, etc. 
1d.06 Know why data may need to be ‘cleaned’ before further processing, 
including issues that arise on spreadsheets and apply techniques to 
clean data in context. 
In the pre-processing stage: consideration of genuine and other outliers 
and anomalies, or removal of extraneous symbols or notation when using 
technology (e.g. spreadsheets or statistical software). See also 2c.03. 
1d.07 Know the importance of identifying and controlling 
extraneous variables. 
 
2. Processing, representing and analysing data 
(a) Tabulation, diagrams and representation 
2a.01 Represent data sets pictorially using calculated key values as 
necessary, and interpret and compare data sets displayed pictorially: 
tabulation, tally, pictogram, pie chart, stem and leaf diagram, Venn 
diagram. 
Use of two-way tables is expected. 
Diagrams should have a key where appropriate. 
Stem and leaf diagrams need to be ordered to allow identification of key 
values.

What students need to learn: Guidance 
(a) Tabulation, diagrams and representation continued 
2a.02 Interpret and compare data sets displayed pictorially: population 
pyramid, choropleth map. 
 
2a.03 Represent data sets graphically using calculated key values as 
necessary, and interpret and compare data sets displayed graphically: 
bar charts, line graphs, time series, scatter diagrams, bar line (vertical 
line) charts, frequency polygons, cumulative frequency (discrete and 
grouped) charts, histograms (equal class width), and box plots. 
Use of multiple and composite (including percentage composite) bar 
charts is expected. 
No distinction will be made between cumulative frequency polygons (other 
than step polygons) and curves, while frequency polygons could be open 
or closed. 
Note: the ‘y’ axis of histograms may be labelled ‘frequency’ where equal 
class widths are used. (Frequency density is Higher tier only.) 
2a.04 (Higher tier topic only; not assessed at Foundation tier)  
2a.05 Justify the appropriate format and produce accurate visualisation 
of data. 
Be familiar with the capabilities and advantages of using statistical 
software and spreadsheets to produce suitable diagrams and graphs, and 
know to avoid the inappropriate use of such technology. 
Appropriate format could take account of target audience. e.g. realising 
when a simple visualisation of data is appropriate, and when a more 
technical visualisation is appropriate. 
2a.06 Recognise where errors in construction lead to graphical 
misrepresentation, including but not limited to incorrect scales, 
truncated axis, distorted sizing. 
Correct use of class boundaries is required. 
Understand the possible distortion when interpreting 3D representations. 
2a.07 Extract and calculate corresponding values in order to compare data 
sets that have been presented in different formats and be able to 
present the same information in multiple formats. 
Including extracting information from spreadsheets, lists of statistics or 
graphs produced by statistical software. 
2a.08 Select and justify appropriate form of representation with regard to the 
nature of data. 
e.g. scatter diagrams for bivariate data, histograms for grouped data, etc

What students need to learn: Guidance 
(a) Tabulation, diagrams and representation continued 
2a.09 Determine skewness from data by inspection. For example, know that positive skew could be indicated by: 
● mean > median > mode  
● median − LQ < UQ − median 
2a.10 Interpret a distribution of data in terms of skewness identified from 
inspection. 
For example, with positive skew know that values above the median have 
a greater spread than values below the median. 
(b) Measures of central tendency 
2b.01 Calculate averages for discrete and grouped data: mode, median, 
arithmetic mean. 
The term ‘mean’ should be understood to be ‘arithmetic mean’. 
Calculations of mean and median for grouped data will include equal class 
widths. Linear interpolation for median is expected. 
Use of class midpoints (mid-interval values) to find an estimate of the 
mean of grouped data is expected. 
Understand the effect on the mean, mode and median of changes in the 
data, including the addition or withdrawal of a population or sample 
member. 
Understand the effect of transformations of the data on the mean, mode 
and median. (Transformations will be restricted to simple scaling and 
translations.) 
2b.02 Justify the rationale for selecting appropriate types of average in 
context. 
e.g. mode is appropriate when considering demand for items of clothing 
in different sizes, or when data is non-numeric;  
e.g. median is more appropriate than mean if data is skewed; etc 
e.g. mean is appropriate to take account of all data 
2b.03 Compare different data sets using appropriate calculated or given 
measure of central tendency: mode, modal class, median and mean. 
An awareness of which measure is more appropriate to use is expected, 
e.g. selecting the appropriate values from those produced by statistical 
software.

What students need to learn: Guidance 
(c) Measures of dispersion 
2c.01 Calculate different measures of spread: range, quartiles, interquartile 
range (IQR), percentiles. 
Any value of n may be expected, so that required bounds (e.g. quartiles) 
may or may not be values in the data set. Alternative methods will be 
acceptable provided that the method used is clear from the working. 
(e.g. if the median lies between two data values the arithmetic mean of 
these two values may be used.) 
2c.02 Identify outliers by inspection.  
2c.03 Comment on outliers with reference to the original data. Know that outliers may be genuine unusual values or may be the result of 
errors in recording data. 
2c.04 Compare different data sets using appropriate calculated or given 
measure of spread: range, interquartile range (IQR), percentiles. 
An awareness of which measure is more appropriate to use is expected, 
e.g. selecting the appropriate values from those produced by statistical 
software. 
2c.05 Use calculated or given median and interquartile range (IQR) to 
compare data samples and to compare sample data with population 
data. 
The appropriate pairing of a measure of central tendency and a measure 
of dispersion is expected. (e.g. use of mean with IQR is not appropriate.) 
2c.06 (Higher tier topic only; not assessed at Foundation tier)  
(d) Further summary statistics 
2d.01 Use different types of index numbers in context, including but not 
limited to retail price index (RPI), consumer price index (CPI) and 
gross domestic product (GDP). 
Calculation and interpretation of simple index numbers is expected. 
2d.02 Interpret data related to rates of change over time (including, but not 
limited to, percentage change, births, deaths, house prices, and 
unemployment) when given in graphical form. Calculate and interpret 
rates of change over time from tables using context specific formula. 
Making predictions using rates of change formulae is expected, 
e.g. 
crude birth rate = number of births  1000
total population
×  
Formula will be given.

What students need to learn: Guidance 
(e) Scatter diagrams and correlation 
2e.01 Know and apply vocabulary of correlation: positive, negative, zero, 
causation, association, interpolation and extrapolation. 
Know that a dependent variable should be plotted on the ‘y’ axis. 
2e.02 Describe and make comparisons of correlation by inspection: strong or 
weak. 
e.g. Informal interpretation using scatter diagrams. 
2e.03 Know that correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Be aware of spurious correlation. e.g. car ownership and birth rate in a 
number of cities may show correlation as both variables are likely to be 
affected by population size of the cities. 
 
2e.04 Determine line of best fit by eye, by drawing through a calculated 
double mean point ),( yx  
Awareness of issues relating to interpolation and extrapolation, and the 
interpretation of gradient and intercept are expected. 
Non-linear models will not be tested. 
2e.05 (Higher tier topic only; not assessed at Foundation tier)  
2e.06 Interpret given Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient in the context 
of the problem. 
Be aware that values range on a scale from -1 to +1. Know that values 
closer to these limits indicate ‘stronger’ correlation, but no formal 
interpretation of strength of correlation is expected. 
e.g. in comparing ranks given by two judges in a competition know that 
+1 means perfect agreement, -1 means complete opposite ranks, and 0 
means no agreement between ranks given.

3. Probability 
3p.01 Use collected data to calculate estimates of probabilities. Use of relative frequency. 
3p.02 Compare the probability of different possible outcomes using the 0–1 
or 0–100% scale and statements of likelihood. 
Locate events on a probability scale and use the language of likelihood 
(e.g. certain, impossible, evens, likely, very unlikely, etc.) 
3p.03 Use probability values to calculate expected frequency of a specified 
characteristic within a sample or population. 
Given total frequency, use probability as a proportion to find expected 
frequency. 
3p.04 Use collected data and calculated probabilities to determine and 
interpret relative risks and absolute risks, and express in terms of 
expected frequencies in groups. 
e.g. use driving test pass rate data with Instructor A and Instructor B to 
determine the probability (absolute risk) of passing with A, or determine 
the relative probability (relative risk) of passing with A compared with B. 
                        = risk of passing with ARelative risk 
risk of passing with B

possible bias within the experimental design. 
e.g. consider whether a set of dice rolls suggest that the dice is fair 
3p.06 Recognise that experimental probability will tend towards theoretical 
probability as the number of trials increases when all variables are 
random. 
Understand that increasing sample size generally leads to better 
estimates of probability and population parameters. 
Students may be expected to estimate probabilities from relative 
frequency diagrams and frequency tables. 
3p.07 Use two-way tables, sample space diagrams, tree diagrams and Venn 
diagrams to represent all the different outcomes possible for at most 
three events. 
Use of these for conditional probability is expected. (See 3p.09.) 
Sample space diagrams may include listing or tabulating all outcomes of 
single events, or successive events, in a systematic way.

necessary, and interpret and compare data sets displayed pictorially: 
tabulation, tally, pictogram, pie chart, stem and leaf diagram, Venn 
diagram. 
Use of two-way tables is expected. 
Diagrams should have a key where appropriate. 
Stem and leaf diagrams need to be ordered to allow identification of key 
values. 
2a.02 Interpret and compare data sets displayed pictorially: population 
pyramid, choropleth map, comparative pie chart, comparative 2D 
representations, comparative 3D representations. 
The relationship between area and frequency, and calculations of 
radius, for comparative pie charts is expected.

necessary, and interpret and compare data sets displayed graphically: 
bar charts, line graphs, time series, scatter diagrams, bar line (vertical 
line) charts, frequency polygons, cumulative frequency (discrete and 
grouped) charts, histograms (equal class width), and box plots. 
Use of multiple and composite (including percentage composite) bar 
charts is expected. 
No distinction will be made between cumulative frequency polygons 
(other than step polygons) and curves, while frequency polygons could be 
open or closed. 
Note: the ‘y’ axis of histograms may be labelled ‘frequency’ where equal 
class widths are used.

software and spreadsheets to produce suitable diagrams and graphs, and 
know to avoid the inappropriate use of such technology. 
Appropriate format could take account of target audience. e.g. realising 
when a simple visualisation of data is appropriate, and when a more 
technical visualisation is appropriate. 
2a.06 Recognise where errors in construction lead to graphical 
misrepresentation, including but not limited to incorrect scales, 
truncated axis, distorted sizing or the misuse of formula when 
calculating the frequency densities of histograms.  
Correct use of class boundaries is required, including in the calculation 
of frequency densities. 
Understand the possible distortion when interpreting 3D representations. 
2a.07 Extract and calculate corresponding values in order to compare data

arithmetic mean, weighted mean, geometric mean, mean 
seasonal variation. 
The term ‘mean’ should be understood to be ‘arithmetic mean’ unless 
‘geometric mean’ is stated. 
Calculations of mean and median for grouped data will include equal or 
unequal class widths. Linear interpolation for median is expected. 
Use of class midpoints (mid-interval values) to estimate mean of grouped 
data is expected. 
Understand the effect on the mean, mode and median of changes in the 
data, including the addition or withdrawal of a population or sample 
member.

and median. (Transformations will be restricted to simple scaling and 
translations.) 
2b.02 Justify the rationale for selecting appropriate types of average in 
context. 
e.g. mode is appropriate when considering demand for items of clothing 
in different sizes, or when data is non-numeric;  
e.g. median more appropriate than mean if data is skewed; etc 
e.g. mean is appropriate to take account of all data and allows 
calculation of standard deviation

e.g. selecting the appropriate values from those produced by statistical 
software. 
(c) Measures of dispersion 
2c.01 Calculate different measures of spread: range, quartiles, interquartile 
range (IQR), percentiles, interpercentile range, interdecile range 
and standard deviation. 
For example, 10th to 90th interpercentile range. 
Any value of n may be expected, so that required bounds (e.g. quartiles) 
may or may not be values in the data set. Alternative methods will be 
acceptable provided that the method used is clear from the working.  
(e.g. if the median lies between two data values the arithmetic mean of 
these two values may be used.) 
For standard deviation only the formulae for a set of values are

software. 
2c.05 Use calculated or given median and interquartile range (IQR) or 
interpercentile range or interdecile range or mean and standard 
deviation to compare data samples and to compare sample data with 
population data. 
The appropriate pairing of a measure of central tendency and a measure 
of dispersion is expected. (e.g. use of mean with IQR is not appropriate.) 
2c.06 Use calculated or given means and standard deviation to 
standardise and interpret data collected in two comparable

2e.02 Describe and make comparisons of correlation by inspection: strong or 
weak. 
e.g. Informal interpretation using scatter diagrams. 
2e.03 Know that correlation does not necessarily imply causation and 
multiple factors may interact. 
Be aware of spurious correlation. e.g. car ownership and birth rate in a 
number of cities may show correlation as both variables are likely to be 
affected by population size of the cities.

in the context of the problem. 
Be aware that values range on a scale from -1 to +1. Know that values 
closer to these limits indicate ‘stronger’ correlation, but no formal 
interpretation of strength of correlation is expected. 
e.g. in comparing ranks given by two judges in a competition know that 
+1 means perfect agreement, -1 means complete opposite ranks, and 0 
means no agreement between ranks given. 
2e.07 Interpret given Pearson’s product moment correlation 
coefficient (PMCC) in the context of the problem. 
 
Be aware that values range on a scale from -1 to +1. Know that 
values closer to these limits indicate ‘stronger’ linear correlation, 
but no formal interpretation of strength of correlation is expected. 
Know that +1 means perfect linear positive correlation, -1 means 
perfect linear negative correlation, and 0 means no linear 
correlation. 
The calculation of PMCC will not be required. 
2e.08 Understand the distinction between Spearman’s rank 
correlation coefficient and Pearson’s product moment 
correlation coefficient (PMCC). 
e.g. recognise the relative strengths of rank correlation and 
product moment correlation on a scatter graph. 
The PMCC measures the strength of linear correlation. 
The calculation of PMCC will not be required. 
e.g. if there is positive non-linear correlation both coefficients will 
be positive but Spearman’s coefficient will be greater than PMCC.

than individual values from the same population. 
e.g. the set of mean heights from each class in a school will show 
less variation than the set of heights of all students in the school. 
2g.02 Use action and warning lines in quality assurance sampling 
applications. 
Control charts used for sample mean, median or range is 
expected. 
For example, in a manufacturing process to test that certain 
measurements are within allowable limits. 
Understand that almost all means, medians or ranges fall inside 
the action lines (action limits), and only 1 in 20 fall outside the

median, mean and mode are equal. 
3p.13 Know that, for a normal distribution, values more than three 
standard deviations from the mean are very unusual; know that 
approximately 95% of the data lie within two standard 
deviations of the mean and that 68% (just over two thirds) lie 
within one standard deviation of the mean 
Be familiar with the conditions which make a normal model 
suitable. 
e.g. that data are continuous, the distribution is symmetrical and 
bell-shaped, and that mean, median and mode are approximately 
equal.

Synoptic assessment  
Synoptic assessment requires students to work across different parts of a qualification and to 
show their accumulated knowledge and understanding of a topic or subject area. 
Synoptic assessment enables students to show their ability to combine their skills, knowledge 
and understanding with breadth and depth of the subject.  
Synopticity will be assessed through the use of extended response questions.

4 Administration and general information 
Entries 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our UK Information Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers and is 
available on our website: qualifications.pearson.com 
Discount code and performance tables 
Centres should be aware that students who enter for more than one GCSE, or other Level 2 
qualifications with the same discount code, will have only the grade for their 'first entry' 
counted for the purpose of the school and college performance tables (please see  
Appendix 7: Codes). For further information about what constitutes 'first entry' and full 
details of how this policy is applied, please refer to the DfE website: 
www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education 
Students should be advised that if they take two GCSEs with the same discount code, 
schools and colleges to which they wish to progress are likely to take the view that this 
achievement is equivalent to only one GCSE. The same view may be taken if students take 
two GCSEs or other Level 2 qualifications that have different discount codes but have 
significant overlap of content. Students or their advisers who have any doubts about their 
subject combinations should check with the institution to which they wish to progress before 
embarking on their programmes. 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, 
special consideration and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
● students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
● all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will be available in English. All student work must be in 
English.  
Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to:  
● access the assessment 
● show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment. 
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) in Statistics – Specification –  
Issue 2 – December 2017 © Pearson Education Limited 2017 
35 
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability, without affecting the integrity of the assessment.  
Access arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty 
under the Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment. 
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable adjustments 
where a person with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in undertaking an 
assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps to overcome 
that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular person may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
including: 
● the needs of the student with the disability 
● the effectiveness of the adjustment 
● the cost of the adjustment; and 
● the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation, or affects timeframes or the security or integrity of the assessment. This is 
because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a student's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the examination/ 
assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material effect on a 
candidate’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate their level of attainment in 
an assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements 
and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
consideration, please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk. 
Malpractice 
Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) in Statistics – Specification 
– Issue 2 – December 2017 © Pearson Education Limited 2017 
36 
Candidate malpractice in examinations must be reported to Pearson using a JCQ Form M1 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to Investigations Team, Pearson, 190 High Holborn, 
London, WC1V 7BH. Please provide as much information and supporting documentation as 
possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice. 
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the 
integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on a 
JCQ Form M2(a) (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form, 
supporting documentation and as much information as possible can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to Investigations Team, Pearson, 
190 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BH. Note that the final decision regarding 
appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
General and Vocational Qualifications Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and 
Assessments Policies and Procedures, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice. 
Awarding and reporting 
This qualification will be graded, awarded and certificated to comply with the requirements of 
Ofqual's General Conditions of Recognition. 
This GCSE qualification will be graded and certificated on a nine-grade scale from 9 to 1 
using the total subject mark where 9 is the highest grade. Individual components/papers are 
not graded. For Foundation tier, grades 1–5 are available and for Higher tier, grades 4–9 are 
available, however if the mark achieved is a smaller number of marks below the 4/3 grade 
boundary, then a grade 3 may be awarded. 
Students whose level of achievement is below the minimum judged by Pearson to be of 
sufficient standard to be recorded on a certificate will receive an unclassified U result. 
The first certification opportunity for this qualification will be 2019.

Appendix 3: Prior knowledge 
It is expected that students entering for this qualification will be familiar with the following 
mathematics. 
Integers, fractions, decimals and percentages 
● work interchangeably with terminating decimals and their corresponding fractions  
(such as 3.5 and 7
2  or 0.375 and 3
8 ) 
● recognise that some fractions can be written as recurring decimals 
● identify and work with fractions in ratio problems 
● interpret fractions and percentages as operators 
Structure and calculation 
● order positive integers, decimals and fractions 
● understand and use the symbols =, ≠, <, >, ≤, ≥ 
● apply the four operations to integers, decimals and simple fractions (proper and improper) 
and mixed numbers 
● understand and use place value (for example when working with very large or very small 
numbers, and when calculating with decimals) 
● understand and use standard form 
● recognise and use relationships between operations, including inverse operations, for 
example cancellation to simplify calculations and expressions; use conventional notation 
for priority of operations, including brackets, powers, roots and reciprocals 
● substitute numerical values into formulae and expressions, including scientific formulae 
● understand and use standard mathematical formulae; rearrange formulae to change the 
subject 
● work with coordinates on Cartesian grid 
Measures and accuracy 
● use standard units of mass, length, time, money and other measures (including standard 
compound measures) using decimal quantities where appropriate 
● estimate answers; check calculations using approximation and estimation, including 
answers obtained using technology 
● use compound units such as speed, rates of pay, unit pricing 
● round numbers and measures to an appropriate degree of accuracy (for example to a 
specified number of decimal places or significant figures); use inequality notation to 
specify simple error intervals due to truncation or rounding

Ratio, proportion and rates of change 
● express one quantity as a fraction of another, where the fraction is less than 1 or 
greater than 1 
● use ratio notation, including reduction to simplest form 
● divide a given quantity into two parts in a given part : part or part : whole ratio; express 
the division of a quantity into two parts as a ratio; apply ratio to real contexts and 
problems (such as those involving probability) 
● relate ratios to fractions and vice versa 
● define percentage as ‘number of parts per hundred’; interpret percentages and percentage 
changes as a fraction or a decimal, and interpret these multiplicatively; express one 
quantity as a percentage of another; compare two quantities using percentages 
• understand and use the general equation of a straight line y = mx + c, where c is the 
intercept with the  
y-axis and

Students must be told these regulations beforehand and they must be familiar with them 
before their assessments for this qualification. 
Students must have a scientific calculator with them for their examinations which they may 
use. They are expected to be familiar with the statistical function keys on their scientific 
calculators. 
 
Calculators must be: 
● of a size suitable for use on a desk 
● either battery or solar powered 
● free of lids, cases and covers that 
have printed instructions or 
formulae. 
 
Calculators must not: 
● be designed or adapted to offer any of these 
facilities: 
o language translators 
o symbolic algebraic manipulation 
o symbolic differentiation or integration 
o communication with other machines or 
the internet 
● be borrowed from another candidate during 
an examination for any reason* 
● have retrievable information stored in them, 
and this includes: 
o databanks 
o dictionaries 
o mathematical formulae 
o text. 
The candidate is responsible for 
the following: 
● the calculator’s power supply 
● the calculator’s working condition 
● clearing anything stored in the 
calculator.

Appendix 5: The context for the 
development of this qualification 
All our qualifications are designed to meet our World Class Qualification Principles[1] and our 
ambition to put the student at the heart of everything we do. 
We have developed and designed this qualification by: 
● reviewing other curricula and qualifications to ensure that it is comparable with those 
taken in high-performing jurisdictions overseas 
● consulting with key stakeholders on content and assessment, including learned bodies, 
subject associations, higher-education academics, teachers and employers to ensure this 
qualification is suitable for a UK context 
● reviewing the legacy qualification and building on its positive attributes. 
This qualification has also been developed to meet criteria stipulated by Ofqual in their 
documents GCSE (9 to 1) Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements and GCSE Subject 
Level Conditions and Requirements for Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) in 
Statistics published in April 2014. 
 
                                           
[1] Pearson’s World Class Qualification Principles ensure that our qualifications are: 
● demanding, through internationally benchmarked standards, encouraging deep learning and 
measuring higher-order skills 
● rigorous, through setting and maintaining standards over time, developing reliable and valid 
assessment tasks and processes, and generating confidence in end users of the knowledge, skills 
and competencies of certified students 
● inclusive, through conceptualising learning as continuous, recognising that students develop at 
different rates and have different learning needs, and focusing on progression 
● empowering, through promoting the development of transferable skills, see Appendix 6.

From Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class Qualifications 
May 2014 
“The reform of the qualifications system in England is a profoundly important change to the 
education system. Teachers need to know that the new qualifications will assist them in 
helping their learners make progress in their lives. 
When these changes were first proposed we were approached by Pearson to join an ‘Expert 
Panel’ that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. 
We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of 
our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe. 
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification development 
process that has included: 
● establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications 
● subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual 
accreditation criteria in advance of submission.  
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented. The 
design has been guided by what is called an ‘Efficacy Framework’, meaning learner outcomes 
have been at the heart of this development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s 
success in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have 
supported the development of qualifications that are outstanding for their coherence, 
thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as representing world-class best 
practice.”

Appendix 6: Transferable skills 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned and 
that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and can be 
built upon and extended through learning.’ [1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework as the most evidence-based and 
robust skills framework. We adapted the framework slightly to include the Program for 
International Student Assessment (PISA) ICT Literacy and Collaborative Problem Solving 
(CPS) Skills. 
The adapted National Research Council’s framework of skills involves: [2]  
Cognitive skills 
● Non-routine problem solving – expert thinking, metacognition, creativity. 
● Systems thinking – decision making and reasoning. 
● Critical thinking – definitions of critical thinking are broad and usually involve general 
cognitive skills such as analysing, synthesising and reasoning skills. 
● ICT literacy – access, manage, integrate, evaluate, construct and communicate. [3]  
Interpersonal skills 
● Communication – active listening, oral communication, written communication, assertive 
communication and non-verbal communication. 
● Relationship-building skills – teamwork, trust, intercultural sensitivity, service 
orientation, self-presentation, social influence, conflict resolution and negotiation. 
● Collaborative problem solving – establishing and maintaining shared understanding, 
taking appropriate action, establishing and maintaining team organisation. 
Intrapersonal skills 
● Adaptability – ability and willingness to cope with the uncertain, handling work stress, 
adapting to different personalities, communication styles and cultures, and physical 
adaptability to various indoor and outdoor work environments. 
● Self-management and self-development – ability to work remotely in virtual teams, 
work autonomously, be self-motivating and self-monitoring, willing and able to acquire 
new information and skills related to work. 
Transferable skills enable young people to face the demands of further and higher education, 
as well as the demands of the workplace, and are important in the teaching and learning of 
this qualification. We will provide teaching and learning materials, developed with 
stakeholders, to support our qualifications.
