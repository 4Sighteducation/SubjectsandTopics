2 Subject content 
Qualification aims and objectives 
GCSE study in the sciences provides the foundation for understanding the material world. 
Scientific understanding is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity. All 
students should learn essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of 
science. They should gain appreciation of how the complex and diverse phenomena of the 
natural world can be described in terms of a small number of key ideas that relate to the 
sciences and that are both inter-linked and of universal application. These key ideas include: 
● the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of 
natural phenomena  
● the assumption that every effect has one or more cause 
● that change is driven by differences between different objects and systems when they 
interact  
● that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time without direct contact 
● that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, 
observation, theory development and review 
● that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific 
methods of inquiry. 
These key ideas are relevant in different ways and with different emphases in the three 
subjects as part of combined science. Examples of their relevance are given for each subject 
in the separate sections below for Biology, Chemistry and Physics components of combined 
science. 
The GCSE in Combined Science should enable students to:  
● develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines 
of Biology, Chemistry and Physics  
● develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science, through different 
types of scientific enquiries that help them to answer scientific questions about the world 
around them 
● develop and learn to apply observational, practical, modelling, enquiry and  
problem-solving skills in the laboratory, in the field and in other learning environments 
● develop their ability to evaluate claims based on science through critical analysis of the 
methodology, evidence and conclusions, both qualitatively and quantitatively.  
Students should study the sciences in ways that help them to develop curiosity about the 
natural world, that give them an insight into how science works and that enable them to 
appreciate its relevance to their everyday lives. The scope and nature of the study should be 
broad, coherent, practical and satisfying. It should encourage students to be inspired, 
motivated and challenged by the subject and its achievements. 
The key ideas specific to the Combined Science content include: 
BIOLOGY 
● life processes depend on molecules whose structure is related to their function 
● the fundamental units of living organisms are cells, which may be part of highly adapted 
structures including tissues, organs and organ systems, enabling living processes to be 
performed effectively  
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9-1) in Combined Science  
Specification – Issue 6 – March 2024 © Pearson Education Limited 2024 
8 
● living organisms may form populations of single species, communities of many species 
and ecosystems, interacting with each other, with the environment and with humans in 
many different ways 
● living organisms are interdependent and show adaptations to their environment 
● life on Earth is dependent on photosynthesis in which green plants and algae trap light 
from the Sun to fix carbon dioxide and combine it with hydrogen from water to make 
organic compounds and oxygen 
● organic compounds are used as fuels in cellular respiration to allow the other chemical 
reactions necessary for life 
● the chemicals in ecosystems are continually cycling through the natural world 
● the characteristics of a living organism are influenced by its genome and its interaction 
with the environment 
● evolution occurs by a process of natural selection and accounts both for biodiversity and 
how organisms are all related to varying degrees.  
CHEMISTRY 
● matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms and there are about 100 different 
naturally occurring types of atoms called elements 
● elements show periodic relationships in their chemical and physical properties 
● these periodic properties can be explained in terms of the atomic structure of the 
elements 
● atoms bond by either transferring electrons from one atom to another or by sharing 
electrons 
● the shapes of molecules (groups of atoms bonded together) and the way giant structures 
are arranged is of great importance in terms of the way they behave 
● there are barriers to reaction so reactions occur at different rates 
● chemical reactions take place in only three different ways: 
o proton transfer 
o electron transfer 
o electron sharing 
● energy is conserved in chemical reactions so can therefore be neither created nor 
destroyed. 
PHYSICS 
● the use of models, as in the particle model of matter or the wave models of light and of 
sound 
● the concept of cause and effect in explaining such links as those between force and 
acceleration, or between changes in atomic nuclei and radioactive emissions 
● the phenomena of ‘action at a distance’ and the related concept of the field as the key to 
analysing electrical, magnetic and gravitational effects 
● that differences, for example between pressures or temperatures or electrical potentials, 
are the drivers of change 
● that proportionality, for example between weight and mass of an object or between force 
and extension in a spring, is an important aspect of many models in science 
● that physical laws and models are expressed in mathematical form. 
All of these key ideas will be assessed as part of this qualification, through the subject 
content.

Students need to record the work that they have undertaken for the 18 mandatory core 
practicals. The practical record must include the knowledge, skills and understanding they 
have derived from the practical activities. Centres must complete and submit a Practical 
Science Statement (see Appendix 7) to confirm that all students have completed the 18 
mandatory core practicals. This must be submitted to Pearson by 15th April in the year that 
the students will sit their examinations. Any failure by centres to provide this Practical 
Science Statement will be treated as malpractice and/or maladministration.

Scientific diagrams should be included, where appropriate, to show the set-up and to record 
the apparatus and procedures used in practical work. 
It is important to realise that these core practicals are the minimum number of practicals 
that should be taken during the course. Suggested additional practicals are given beneath 
the content at the end of each topic. The 18 mandatory core practicals cover all aspects of 
the apparatus and techniques listed in Appendix 6: Apparatus and techniques. This appendix 
also includes more detailed instructions for each core practical, which must be followed. 
Safety is an overriding requirement for all practical work. Centres are responsible for 
ensuring appropriate safety procedures are followed whenever their students complete 
practical work. 
These core practicals may be reviewed and amended if changes are required to the 
apparatus and techniques listed by the Department for Education. Pearson may also review 
and amend the core practicals if necessary. Centres will be told as soon as possible about 
any changes to core practicals.

Synoptic assessment 
Synoptic assessment requires students to work across different parts of a qualification and to 
show their accumulated knowledge and understanding of a topic or subject area. 
Synoptic assessment enables students to show their ability to combine their skills, knowledge 
and understanding with breadth and depth of the individual sciences.  
Questions that naturally draw together different aspects of biology or chemistry or physics 
will assess synopticity.

4 Administration and general information 
Entries 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our UK Information Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers and is 
available on our website: qualifications.pearson.com 
Discount code and performance tables 
Centres should be aware that students who enter for more than one GCSE, or other Level 2 
qualifications with the same discount code, will have only the grade for their 'first entry' 
counted for the purpose of the school and college performance tables (please see 
Appendix 10: Codes). For further information about what constitutes 'first entry' and full 
details of how this policy is applied, please refer to the DfE website: 
www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education 
Students should be advised that if they take two GCSEs with the same discount code, 
schools and colleges they wish to progress to are likely to take the view that this 
achievement is equivalent to only one GCSE. The same view may be taken if students take 
two GCSEs or other Level 2 qualifications that have different discount codes but have 
significant overlap of content. Students or their advisers who have any doubts about their 
subject combinations should check with the institution they wish to progress to before 
embarking on their programmes. 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, 
special consideration and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
● students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
● all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will be available in English. All student work must be in 
English.

Specification – Issue 6 – March 2024 © Pearson Education Limited 2024

Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to:  
● access the assessment 
● show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment.  
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability, without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under the 
Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment.  
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable adjustments 
where a person with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in undertaking an 
assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps to overcome 
that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular person may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
which will include: 
● the needs of the student with the disability 
● the effectiveness of the adjustment 
● the cost of the adjustment; and 
● the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation, timeframes or affects the security or integrity of the assessment. This is 
because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a student's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the examination/ 
assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material effect on a 
candidate’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate their level of attainment in  
an assessment. 
Private candidates 
Private candidates can complete this qualification only if they carry-out the mandatory core 
practicals with the centre in which they are sitting the exams, as long as the centre is willing 
to accept the candidate. These candidates need to fulfil the same requirements as all other 
candidates.

Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements 
and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
consideration, please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk. 
Malpractice 
Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in examinations must be reported to Pearson using a JCQ Form M1 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form should be emailed to 
candidatemalpractice@pearson.com. Please provide as much information and supporting 
documentation as possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies with 
Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice. 
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the 
integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on  
a JCQ Form M2(a) (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form, 
supporting documentation and as much information as possible should be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com. Note that the final decision regarding  
appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More-detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
General and Vocational Qualifications Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and 
Assessments Policies and Procedures, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice. 
Awarding and reporting 
This qualification will be graded, awarded and certificated to comply with the requirements of 
Ofqual's General Conditions of Recognition. 
This GCSE qualification will be graded and certificated on a 17-grade scale from 9–9 to 1–1 
using the total subject mark where 9–9 is the highest grade. Individual papers are not 
graded. For foundation tier, grades 1–1 to 5–5 are available and for higher tier, grades 4–4 
to 9–9 are available, however if the mark achieved is a small number of marks below the  
4–4 grade boundary, then a grade 4–3 may be awarded. 
Students whose level of achievement is below the minimum judged by Pearson to be of 
sufficient standard to be recorded on a certificate will receive an unclassified U result. 
The first certification opportunity for this qualification will be 2018.

Student recruitment and progression 
Pearson follows the JCQ policy concerning recruitment to our qualifications in that: 
● they must be available to anyone who is capable of reaching the required standard 
● they must be free from barriers that restrict access and progression 
● equal opportunities exist for all students. 
Prior learning and other requirements 
This qualification is based on the subject content, published by the DfE. The DfE designed the 
subject content to reflect or build on Key Stage 3. Consequently, students taking this 
qualification will benefit from previously studying Biology, Chemistry and Physics at Key 
Stage 3.

Students can progress from this qualification to: 
● GCEs, for example in Biology, Chemistry and/or Physics 
● Level 3 vocational qualifications in science, for example. BTEC Level 3 in Applied Science 
● employment, for example in a science-based industry where an Apprenticeship may be 
available. 
The content and skills for these qualifications are set by the DfE to be suitable to allow these 
progression routes.

BIOLOGY 
Core practical Description 
1.6 
Investigate biological 
specimens using 
microscopes including 
magnification calculations 
and labelled scientific 
drawings from 
observations 
This practical allows students to develop their skills in 
using a light microscope, preparing slides, and 
producing labelled scientific drawings. Students need to 
be familiar with the set-up and use of a light 
microscope, as well as to be able to identify structures 
that they see. Magnification calculations will also be 
required.  
1.10 Investigate the effect of 
pH on enzyme activity 
For this core practical students will investigate the 
effect of pH, however other variables can also be 
investigated to enhance practical work in this area. 
This method uses amylase (in solutions of different pH) 
to break down starch. The reaction can be monitored 
by using iodine to test the presence of starch in the 
solution with a continuous sampling method. To 
maintain the temperature of the solution, a Bunsen 
burner and water beaker must be used.

Core practical Description 
1.16 Investigate osmosis in 
potatoes 
A known mass of potato must be added to sucrose 
solution, left for some time, and the final mass 
recorded to obtain the percentage change in mass. This 
investigation looks at the exchange of water between 
the potato and solution and allows the concentration of 
sucrose in the potato to be determined. The practical 
provides an opportunity for the appreciation of the 
need to control variables. 
6.5 
Investigate the effect of 
light intensity on the rate 
of photosynthesis 
Algal balls (or similar) must be set up and placed at 
varying distances from a light source to investigate the 
effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis. 
The rate must be measured and compared to the 
distance away from the light source. 
8.11 
Investigate the rate of 
respiration in living 
organisms 
Use of a simple respirometer to measure the effect of 
temperature on the oxygen consumption of some small 
organisms. A simple respirometer can be made using a 
tube with soda lime, cotton wool and organisms with a 
capillary tube to coloured liquid. Students can then 
track the progress of the liquid up the capillary tube 
over a set time. This experiment must be carried out 
using a water bath set at different temperatures. 
Safety and ethical considerations must also be covered. 
9.5 
Investigate the 
relationship between 
organisms and their 
environment using field-
work techniques, including 
quadrats and belt 
transects 
This investigation involves the use of a belt transect 
along a gradient (e.g. shaded area to an area with no 
shade). It involves students thinking about how to 
sample their chosen area, including the identification 
and observation of plants/organisms.

CHEMISTRY 
Core practical Description 
2.11 
Investigate the composition 
of inks using simple 
distillation and paper 
chromatography 
This core practical is in two parts; a simple 
chromatography practical to obtain a chromatogram 
of dyes in ink and using simple distillation apparatus 
to separate pure water from ink.  
It needs to cover usage of a Bunsen burner, 
methods used in chromatography and distillation 
and safety of handling liquids. 
3.6 
Investigate the change in pH 
on adding powdered calcium 
hydroxide or calcium oxide to 
a fixed volume of dilute 
hydrochloric acid 
This practical focuses on recording the pH at 
intervals when calcium hydroxide or calcium oxide 
reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid. An initial mass 
of the solid must be added to a fixed volume of the 
acid, and the pH recorded each time more of the 
solid is added to the acid. The pH can be recorded 
using a pH meter, or universal indicator paper with 
a glass rod used to take a pH measurement at each 
interval. 
3.17 
Investigate the preparation of 
pure, dry hydrated copper 
sulfate crystals starting from 
copper oxide including the 
use of a water bath 
Excess copper oxide must be added to warm dilute 
sulfuric acid (warmed using a water bath), which 
will react to produce a blue solution of the salt 
copper(II) sulfate. The solution then needs to be 
filtered using filter paper and evaporated using an 
evaporating basin and Bunsen burner, followed by 
final drying using a watch glass to allow all the 
water to evaporate. 
3.31 
Investigate the electrolysis of 
copper sulfate solution with 
inert electrodes and copper 
electrodes 
This involves setting up an electrolysis to investigate 
the effect of changing the current on the mass of 
the copper electrodes used in the electrolysis of 
copper sulfate solution. The second part of this 
investigation covers the products formed during the 
electrolysis of copper sulfate solution using inert 
(graphite) electrodes. Quantitative analysis when 
using copper electrodes will be expected.

Core practical Description 
7.1 
Investigate the effects of 
changing the conditions of a 
reaction on the rates of 
chemical reactions by:  
a measuring the production 
of a gas (in the reaction 
between hydrochloric acid 
and marble chips)  
b observing a colour change 
(in the reaction between 
sodium thiosulfate and 
hydrochloric acid) 
This investigation is in two parts. Both parts require 
the reaction to be observed with respect to time to 
obtain the rate. 
In the first part, marble chips must be added to 
hydrochloric acid, and the volume of gas collected 
and measured over time. This will lead to graphical 
analysis to calculate rate, as well as an appreciation 
for how the rate may change with varying 
concentration of acid/temperature/surface area of 
marble chips. 
The second part involves sodium thiosulfate reacting 
with dilute hydrochloric acid to produce a precipitate 
using the idea of a ‘disappearing cross’ to observe 
the change in the appearance of the reaction 
mixture as a precipitate of sulfur is formed. This 
must be carried out at different temperatures by 
warming the thiosulfate solution. A graph must be 
drawn to show the time taken for the reaction to 
take place at different temperatures.  
 
PHYSICS 
Core practical Description 
2.19 
Investigate the relationship 
between force, mass and 
acceleration by varying the 
masses added to trolleys 
Different masses must be used to investigate the 
effect of varying masses on the acceleration of a 
trolley down a ramp. Appropriate methods must be 
used to measure the force and time taken for the 
trolley to travel down the ramp, and data analysis 
must include calculating the acceleration.  
4.17 
Investigate the suitability of 
equipment to measure the 
speed, frequency and 
wavelength of a wave in a 
solid and a fluid 
This investigation involves looking at the 
characteristics of waves and using the equation:  
λ×= fv  
It is expected that students will have looked at waves 
in a liquid using a ripple tank, and waves in a solid 
using a metal rod and a method of measuring the 
frequency. Suitability of apparatus to take these 
measurements must also be considered. 
5.9 
Investigate refraction in 
rectangular glass blocks in 
terms of the interaction of 
electromagnetic waves with 
matter 
A light source with grating must be used to produce a 
beam of light, which must then be used to investigate 
the effect of refraction using a glass block. An 
appreciation of the interaction of the light ray with the 
glass block and the effect of changing medium on the 
light ray (moving towards and away from the normal) 
must be included.

Core practical Description

Construct electrical circuits 
to: 
a investigate the 
relationship between 
potential difference, 
current and resistance 
for a resistor and a 
filament lamp 
b  test series and parallel 
circuits using resistors 
and filament lamps 
This investigation involves constructing a circuit to 
investigate potential difference, current and 
resistance for a resistor and a filament lamp. The 
behaviour of parallel and series circuits must also be 
included, and this must be done using filament lamps. 
A series circuit should be set up initially with a 
resistor, ammeter and voltmeter. The current must 
be recorded at different voltages. This must then be 
repeated using a filament lamp instead of a resistor.  
To investigate series and parallel circuits, a parallel 
circuit must be set up with ammeters, voltmeters, 
and filament lamps. Readings from this circuit must 
then be compared with series circuits used initially. 
Analysis must include use of the equation: 
RIV ×=  
14.3 Investigate the densities of 
solid and liquids 
The density of a solid object must be determined by 
measuring the mass and volume of the object, and 
then using the equation: 
v
mρ =  
The volume must be determined by putting the object 
into water, and measuring the volume of water that 
has been displaced. 
The density of a liquid can be calculated by weighing 
the liquid using a balance, and determining the 
volume. The equation: 
v
mρ =  
must then be used to calculate the density. 
14.11 
Investigate the properties of 
water by determining the 
specific heat capacity of 
water and obtaining a 
temperature-time graph for 
melting ice 
The temperature of crushed ice must be recorded 
using a thermometer. This must then be melted using 
a Bunsen burner and beaker of water as a water bath. 
The temperature must be monitored as the ice melts. 
To determine specific heat capacity of water, the 
temperature of water using a thermometer must be 
monitored while heating it using a heat supply 
connected to a joulemeter. This must then be used to 
calculate the specific heat capacity. 
15.6 
Investigate the extension 
and work done when 
applying forces to a spring 
The stretching of a spring must be investigated by 
measuring the length of a spring with no weights, 
followed by adding varying masses and measuring 
the new length. This must include calculating the 
work done and an appreciation of the forces involved.

documents GCSE (9 to 1) Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements and GCSE Subject 
Level Conditions and Requirements for Combined Science, published in April 2014. 
 
 
[1] Pearson’s World Class Qualification Principles ensure that our qualifications are: 
● demanding, through internationally benchmarked standards, encouraging deep learning 
and measuring higher-order skills 
● rigorous, through setting and maintaining standards over time, developing reliable and 
valid assessment tasks and processes, and generating confidence in end users of the 
knowledge, skills and competencies of certified students 
● inclusive, through conceptualising learning as continuous, recognising that students 
develop at different rates and have different learning needs, and focusing on progression 
● empowering, through promoting the development of transferable skills, see Appendix 9.

From Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class Qualifications 
May 2014 
“The reform of the qualifications system in England is a profoundly important change to the 
education system. Teachers need to know that the new qualifications will assist them in 
helping their learners make progress in their lives. 
When these changes were first proposed we were approached by Pearson to join an ‘Expert 
Panel’ that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. 
We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of 
our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe. 
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification development 
process that has included: 
● extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-performing 
jurisdictions in the world 
● benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they are at 
the right level of demand 
● establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications 
● subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual 
accreditation criteria in advance of submission.  
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented. The 
design has been guided by what is called an ‘Efficacy Framework’, meaning learner outcomes 
have been at the heart of this development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s 
success in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have 
supported the development of qualifications that are outstanding for their coherence, 
thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as representing world-class best 
practice.

Appendix 9: Transferable skills 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned and 
that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and can be 
built upon and extended through learning.’ [1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework as the most evidence-based and 
robust skills framework. We adapted the framework slightly to include the Program for 
International Student Assessment (PISA) ICT Literacy and Collaborative Problem Solving 
(CPS) Skills. 
The adapted National Research Council’s framework of skills involves: [2]  
Cognitive skills 
● Non-routine problem solving – expert thinking, metacognition, creativity. 
● Systems thinking – decision making and reasoning. 
● Critical thinking – definitions of critical thinking are broad and usually involve general 
cognitive skills such as analysing, synthesising and reasoning skills. 
● ICT literacy – access, manage, integrate, evaluate, construct and communicate. [3]  
Interpersonal skills 
● Communication – active listening, oral communication, written communication, assertive 
communication and non-verbal communication. 
● Relationship-building skills – teamwork, trust, intercultural sensitivity, service 
orientation, self-presentation, social influence, conflict resolution and negotiation. 
● Collaborative problem solving – establishing and maintaining shared understanding, 
taking appropriate action, establishing and maintaining team organisation. 
Intrapersonal skills 
● Adaptability – ability and willingness to cope with the uncertain, handling work stress, 
adapting to different personalities, communication styles and cultures, and physical 
adaptability to various indoor and outdoor work environments. 
● Self-management and self-development – ability to work remotely in virtual teams, 
work autonomously, be self-motivating and self-monitoring, willing and able to acquire 
new information and skills related to work. 
Transferable skills enable young people to face the demands of further and higher education, 
as well as the demands of the workplace, and are important in the teaching and learning of 
this qualification. We will provide teaching and learning materials, developed with 
stakeholders, to support our qualifications.
