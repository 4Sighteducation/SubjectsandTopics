From Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class Qualifications 
 
  The reform of the qualifications system in England is a profoundly important change 
to the education system. Teachers need to know that the new qualifications will assist 
them in helping their learners make progress in their lives. 
When these changes were first proposed we were approached by Pearson to join an 
‘Expert Panel’ that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. 
We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or 
because of our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the 
world as diverse as Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across 
Europe. 
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification 
development process that has included: 
● Extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-
performing jurisdictions in the world 
● Benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they 
are at the right level of demand 
● Establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-
specific expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications 
● Subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual 
accreditation criteria in advance of submission.  
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future 
oriented. The design has been guided by what is called an ‘Efficacy Framework’, 
meaning learner outcomes have been at the heart of this development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a 
learner’s success in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident that 
we have supported the development of qualifications that are outstanding for their 
coherence, thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as representing 
world-class best practice.

Introduction 
The Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9 to 1) in Mathematics is designed for 
use in schools and colleges. It is part of a suite of GCSE qualifications offered by 
Pearson. 
Purpose of the specification 
This specification sets out: 
● the objectives of the qualification 
● any other qualification that a student must have completed before taking the 
qualification 
● any prior knowledge and skills that the student is required to have before taking 
the qualification 
● any other requirements that a student must have satisfied before they will be 
assessed or before the qualification will be awarded 
● the knowledge and understanding that will be assessed as part of the 
qualification 
● the method of assessment and any associated requirements relating to it 
● the criteria against which a student’s level of attainment will be measured (such 
as assessment criteria).  
 
 
Rationale 
The Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) in Mathematics meets the 
following purposes, which fulfil those defined by the Office of Qualifications and 
Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) for GCSE qualifications in their GCSE (9 to 1) 
Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements document, published in April 2014. 
The purposes of this qualification are to: 
● provide evidence of students’ achievements against demanding and fulfilling 
content, to give students the confidence that the mathematical skills, knowledge 
and understanding that they will have acquired during the course of their study 
are as good as that of the highest performing jurisdictions in the world 
● provide a strong foundation for further academic and vocational study and for 
employment, to give students the appropriate mathematical skills, knowledge 
and understanding to help them progress to a full range of courses in further 
and higher education. This includes Level 3 mathematics courses as well as 
Level 3 and undergraduate courses in other disciplines such as biology, 
geography and psychology, where the understanding and application of 
mathematics is crucial 
● provide (if required) a basis for schools and colleges to be held accountable for 
the performance of all of their students. 
Qualification aims and objectives 
The aims and objectives of the Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) in 
Mathematics are to enable students to: 
● develop fluent knowledge, skills and understanding of mathematical methods 
and concepts 
● acquire, select and apply mathematical techniques to solve problems 
● reason mathematically, make deductions and inferences, and draw conclusions 
● comprehend, interpret and communicate mathematical information in a variety 
of forms appropriate to the information and context. 
 
 
The context for the development of this qualification 
All our qualifications are designed to meet our World Class Qualification Principles[1] 
and our ambition to put the student at the heart of everything we do. 
We have developed and designed this qualification by: 
● reviewing other curricula and qualifications to ensure that it is comparable with 
those taken in high-performing jurisdictions overseas 
● consulting with key stakeholders on content and assessment, including learned 
bodies, subject associations, higher-education academics, teachers and 
employers to ensure this qualification is suitable for a UK context 
● reviewing the legacy qualification and building on its positive attributes.  
This qualification has also been developed to meet criteria stipulated by Ofqual in 
their documents GCSE (9 to 1) Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements and 
GCSE Subject Level Conditions and Requirements for Mathematics, published in 
April 2014. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[1] Pearson’s World Class Qualification principles ensure that our qualifications are: 
● demanding, through internationally benchmarked standards, encouraging deep 
learning and measuring higher-order skills 
● rigorous, through setting and maintaining standards over time, developing 
reliable and valid assessment tasks and processes, and generating confidence in 
end users of the knowledge, skills and competencies of certified students 
● inclusive, through conceptualising learning as continuous, recognising that 
students develop at different rates and have different learning needs, and 
focusing on progression 
● empowering, through promoting the development of transferable skills, see 
Appendix 1.

Entry and assessment information 
Student entry 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for 
this qualification can be found in our UK Information 
Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations 
officers and is available on our website at: 
www.edexcel.com/iwantto/Pages/uk-information-
manual.aspx 
Forbidden combinations and discount code 
There are two tiers of entry available. Each student is 
permitted to take assessments in either the Foundation tier 
or Higher tier. All three papers must be from the same tier 
of entry and must be completed in the same assessment 
series.  
Centres should be aware that students who enter for more 
than one GCSE or other Level 2 qualifications with the same 
discount code will have only the grade for their 'first entry' 
counted for the purpose of the School and College 
Performance Tables (please see Appendix 2: Codes). For 
further information about what constitutes 'first entry' and 
full details of how this policy is applied, please refer to the 
DfE website: www.education.gov.uk 
Students should be advised that, if they take two GCSEs 
with the same discount code, schools and colleges to which 
they wish to progress are very likely to take the view that 
they have achieved only one of the two GCSEs. The same 
view may be taken if students take two GCSE or other Level 
2 qualifications that have different discount codes but have 
significant overlap of content. Students or their advisers 
who have any doubts about their subject combinations 
should check with the institution to which they wish to 
progress before embarking on their programmes. 
November resits 
This qualification is available in both summer and November 
series. Entry to the November series is restricted. Students 
who take GCSE Mathematics in a November series must be 
at least 16 years of age on the preceding 31st August. 
Please go to our website www.edexcel.com for further 
information.

Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and 
special consideration 
Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. 
They allow students with special educational needs, 
disabilities or temporary injuries to:  
● access the assessment 
● show what they know and can do without changing the 
demands of the assessment.  
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the 
particular needs of an individual disabled student without 
affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding 
bodies comply with the duty under the Equality Act 2010 to 
make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the 
start of the course. Students will then know what is 
available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for 
assessment.   
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to 
make reasonable adjustments where a person with a 
disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in 
undertaking an assessment. The awarding organisation is 
required to take reasonable steps to overcome that 
disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular person may be 
unique to that individual and therefore might not be in the 
list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will 
depend on a number of factors, which will include: 
● the needs of the student with the disability 
● the effectiveness of the adjustment 
● the cost of the adjustment; and 
● the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with 
the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves 
unreasonable costs to the awarding organisation, 
timeframes or affects the security or integrity of the 
assessment. This is because the adjustment is not 
‘reasonable’.

Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a 
student's mark or grade to reflect temporary injury, illness 
or other indisposition at the time of the 
examination/assessment, which has had, or is reasonably 
likely to have had, a material effect on a candidate’s ability 
to take an assessment or demonstrate his or her level of 
attainment in an assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for further information about how to 
apply for access arrangements and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, 
reasonable adjustments and special consideration, please

Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality 
policy requires all students to have equal opportunity to 
access our qualifications and assessments, and our 
qualifications to be awarded in a way that is fair to every 
student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
● students with a protected characteristic (as defined by 
the Equality Act 2010) are not, when they are 
undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in 
comparison to students who do not share that 
characteristic 
● all students achieve the recognition they deserve for 
undertaking a qualification and that this achievement 
can be compared fairly to the achievement of their 
peers. 
You can find details on how to make adjustments for 
students with protected characteristics in the policy 
document Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments 
and Special Considerations, which is on our website, 
www.edexcel.com/Policies.

Progression from GCSE 
This qualification prepares students for progression to 
further study of mathematics at AS and A level, and also to 
the study of Core Mathematics. These Level 3 qualifications 
prepare students for a variety of further progression routes. 
Students should seek advice about which of these 
qualifications best prepares them for their intended 
progression routes. 
GCSE Mathematics is a requirement for progression to a 
wide range of courses at Level 3. Students are expected to 
continue with their study of GCSE Mathematics after the 
age of 16 if they have not achieved the qualification at Key 
Stage 4.

Appendix 1: Transferable skills  
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently 
flagged the need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable 
them to respond with confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the 
world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines 
skills, or competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that 
can be learned and that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform 
an activity or task and can be built upon and extended through learning.’1 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected 
and evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this 
process, we identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework as the most 
evidence-based and robust skills framework. We adapted the framework slightly to 
include the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) ICT Literacy and 
Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) Skills. 
The adapted National Research Council’s framework of skills involves:2 
Cognitive skills 
● Non-routine problem solving – expert thinking, metacognition, creativity. 
● Systems thinking – decision making and reasoning. 
● Critical thinking – definitions of critical thinking are broad and usually involve 
general cognitive skills such as analysing, synthesising and reasoning skills.  
● ICT literacy - access, manage, integrate, evaluate, construct and 
communicate3. 
Interpersonal skills 
● Communication – active listening, oral communication, written 
communication, assertive communication and non-verbal communication. 
● Relationship-building skills – teamwork, trust, intercultural sensitivity, 
service orientation, self-presentation, social influence, conflict resolution and 
negotiation. 
● Collaborative problem solving – establishing and maintaining shared 
understanding, taking appropriate action, establishing and maintaining team 
organisation.

Intrapersonal skills 
● Adaptability – ability and willingness to cope with the uncertain, handling work 
stress, adapting to different personalities, communication styles and cultures, 
and physical adaptability to various indoor and outdoor work environments. 
● Self-management and self-development – ability to work remotely in virtual 
teams, work autonomously, be self-motivating and self-monitoring, willing and 
able to acquire new information and skills related to work. 
Transferable skills enable young people to face the demands of further and higher 
education, as well as the demands of the workplace, and are important in the 
teaching and learning of this qualification. We will provide teaching and learning 
materials, developed with stakeholders, to support our qualifications.
