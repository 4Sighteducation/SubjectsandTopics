1 Introduction 
Why choose the Edexcel GCSE in Design and 
Technology? 
We’ve listened to feedback from all parts of the design and technology subject community, 
including teachers, subject associations, professional bodies and higher education. We’ve 
used this opportunity of curriculum change to redesign a qualification that is engaging and 
inspiring, and that reflects the demands of a truly modern and evolving society – a 
qualification that enables your students to apply themselves and develop the practical skills 
needed to succeed in their chosen pathway. 
Building innovative design skills 
Clear routes through the specification – we’ve listened to your feedback and developed a 
new specification that provides clear routes for specialism in the material areas your students 
enjoy, and where you already have the resources and equipment in place. 
Breadth and depth in our exam papers – our exam paper will assess the breadth of 
design and technology knowledge in the Core section, and assess the depth of knowledge in 
the chosen material category for the Specialist section to enable students to fully 
demonstrate their own particular strengths or specialism. 
Creative design and making at the heart – the contextual challenges provided in our 
qualification, for example extending human capacity, will give students the freedom to take 
design risks and to innovate in a situation where it is safe to test and refine ideas. 
Progression to AS and A Level – we’ve designed the GCSE and AS/A Level qualifications 
together to ensure clear progression of knowledge, understanding and design/making skills 
so that students will have a coherent experience of moving from the breadth of the GCSE to 
the specialisation of AS and A Level. 
Support with the new content – to help you plan for first teaching with confidence, we’ll 
be running a range of training events to support you with the new qualification and the new 
requirements. We’ll also give you practical free resources to minimise your lesson planning 
and allow more productive time in the classroom with your students.

2 Subject content and assessment 
information 
The GCSE in Design and Technology enables students to understand and apply iterative 
design processes through which they explore, create and evaluate a range of outcomes. The 
qualification enables students to use creativity and imagination to design and make 
prototypes (together with evidence of modelling to develop and prove product concept and 
function) that solve real and relevant problems, considering their own and others’ needs, 
wants and values. It gives students opportunities to apply knowledge from other disciplines, 
including mathematics, science, art and design, computing and the humanities. 
Students will acquire subject knowledge in design and technology that builds on Key Stage 3, 
incorporating knowledge and understanding of different materials and manufacturing 
processes in order to design and make, with confidence, prototypes in response to issues, 
needs, problems and opportunities. Students learn how to take design risks, helping them to 
become resourceful, innovative and enterprising citizens. They should develop an awareness 
of practices from the creative, engineering and manufacturing industries. Through the 
critique of the outcomes of design and technology activity, both historic and present day, 
students should develop an understanding of its impact on daily life and the wider world and 
understand that high-quality design and technology is important to the creativity, culture, 
sustainability, wealth and wellbeing of the nation and the global community. 
In the context of this document, the term ‘prototype’ refers to a functioning design outcome. 
A final prototype could be a highly-finished product, made as proof of concept before 
manufacture, or working scale models of a system where a full-size product would be 
impractical. 
Qualification aims and objectives 
The study of design and technology seeks to prepare students to participate confidently and 
successfully in an increasingly technological world. It helps students to be aware of, and 
learn from, wider influences on design and technology, including historical, social/cultural, 
environmental and economic factors. 
The aims and objectives of this qualification are to enable students to: 
● demonstrate their understanding that all design and technological activity takes place in 
contexts that influence the outcomes of design practice 
● develop realistic design proposals as a result of the exploration of design opportunities and 
users’ needs, wants and values 
● use imagination, experimentation and combine ideas when designing 
● develop the skills to critique and refine their own ideas while designing and making 
● communicate their design ideas and decisions using different media and techniques, as 
appropriate for different audiences at key points in their designing 
● develop decision-making skills, including the planning and organisation of time and 
resources when managing their own project work 
● develop a broad knowledge of materials, components and technologies and practical skills 
to develop high-quality, imaginative and functional prototypes 
● be ambitious and open to explore and take design risks in order to stretch the 
development of design proposals, avoiding clichéd or stereotypical responses 
● consider the costs, commercial viability and marketing of products

examination for this qualification. Please see Appendix 1: Mathematical skills for full details 
of these maths skills and examples of their application.  
Please see Appendix 2: Calculators for information on the use of calculators in the 
assessments of this qualification.  
Scientific skills, knowledge and understanding 
Science skills, knowledge and understanding underpin the theory and practice of design and 
technology. These skills will be embedded in the examination for this qualification. Please see 
Appendix 3: Science skills, knowledge and understanding for full details of these skills and 
examples of their application. 
Links to other relevant subjects 
In addition to maths and science, the GCSE in Design and Technology embeds knowledge, 
techniques and practices from a wide range of subjects, including art and design, business, 
computer science and geography (see Appendix 4). As part of the teaching of the 
qualification, teachers should use Appendix 4 with the identified links to the subject content, 
to ensure that students gain an awareness and appreciation of the ways in which these 
subject areas relate to and inform decisions in design.

Synoptic assessment 
Synoptic assessment requires students to work across different parts of a qualification and to 
show their accumulated knowledge and understanding of a topic or subject area. 
Synoptic assessment enables students to show their ability to combine their skills, knowledge 
and understanding with breadth and depth of the subject. 
This component assesses synopticity.

Component 2 
Overview 
Students will undertake a project as part of their non-examination assessment. The project 
will test students’ skills in investigating, designing, making and evaluating a prototype of a 
product that will allow them to apply the skills they have acquired and developed throughout 
their study. We provide three themes, each with two contextual challenges. Students are 
required to choose one of these challenges and analyse it on an individual basis. Having 
selected a contextual challenge to work within, students should develop a range of potential 
ideas and then realise one through practical making activities. The project must allow 
students to apply knowledge and understanding in a product development process to 
investigate, design, make and evaluate their prototype. 
This project will require students to follow an iterative design process rather than a linear 
process requiring them to continually test, evaluate and refine ideas. The content and 
assessment criteria are set out in a linear format to show what is required at each stage of 
the total project, but following an iterative process students will do work on different stages 
at a variety of points throughout their project.

Assessment information 
● Students will undertake a project based on a contextual challenge released by us a year 
before certification. This will be released on 1st June and will available on our website. 
● This non-examined assessment will be carried out under controlled conditions, as specified 
on pages 60–62. 
● First assessment: June 2019. 
● The NEA consists of 100 marks. 
● The project consists of a portfolio and a prototype.  
● The teacher responsible for overseeing the student’s work must ensure that a Candidate 
Assessment Booklet* (CAB) is completed for each student. 
● The portfolio and CAB for each student in the sample must be sent to Pearson, in May in the 
year of assessment. Please see our UK Information Manual for the submission deadline date. 
● Centres must ensure that the NEA submitted is valid for the series in which they are 
entered. 
*Further information about how to complete the CAB is provided in the Project setting, 
taking and marking section. 
Contextual challenge 
The contextual challenge will provide a basis from which students will undertake an 
investigate, design, make and evaluate project. We will release this on 1st June, in the year 
before certification. We will provide three themes, each with two contextual challenges. 
Students are required to choose one of these challenges, with advice from the teacher, and 
analyse it on an individual basis. 
Synoptic assessment 
Synoptic assessment requires students to work across different parts of a qualification and to 
show their accumulated knowledge and understanding of a topic or subject area. 
Synoptic assessment enables students to show their ability to combine their skills, knowledge 
and understanding with breadth and depth of the subject. 
This component assesses synopticity. 
Project setting, taking and marking 
Project setting 
Pearson will communicate a contextual challenge to centres in June of the calendar year 
preceding the year in which the qualification is to be awarded. Students will be expected to 
undertake a small-scale project in response to this realistic contextual challenge, taking into 
account the needs and wants of the user. 
Project research 
Teaching and learning 
Teachers should cover the content of this assessment, which covers: 
● investigate 
● design 
● make 
● evaluate.

Project controls relating to student independence and teacher guidance to 
students 
Teachers 
Can: 
● provide broad parameters for students’ design contexts (including areas for investigation, 
availability of equipment, time constraints) 
● explain what a commercial design methodology is 
● advise on health and safety considerations, the use of equipment and potential ethical 
concerns of certain types of materials 
● discuss with students their initial design problems and students' initial approaches to solve 
the problems. 
Must: 
● confirm that the project has the potential to meet the assessment criteria and offer 
general guidance on any necessary amendments 
● review each student’s design brief to ensure that the proposed design brief can suitably 
access the specification requirements and give general guidance on the methodology and 
design tools that the student plans to use 
● promote good practice such as referencing and using a bibliography system 
● store work securely once it is handed in for formal assessment 
● ensure that students keep photographic records of the manufacturing process to evidence 
the quality of manufacturing 
● give students guidance on the safe use of unfamiliar tools and equipment. 
Must not: 
● give students a choice of titles or tasks to choose from 
● give detailed feedback to individual students about how to improve work to meet the 
assessment criteria. The guidance provided before final submission should enable students 
only to take the initiative in making amendments, rather than detailing what amendments 
should be made. This means that teachers must not provide templates and model answers 
for the work of specific students 
● mark work provisionally and share that mark so that students may then improve it 
● return work to students after it has been submitted and marked 
● give guidance on how to make improvements to the portfolio in order to meet the 
assessment criteria so that students are no longer engaged in independent learning.

If teachers give any assistance which goes beyond general advice, they must 
then record this assistance on the CAB and take it into account when marking 
the work, for example1:  
● providing detailed specific guidance on how to improve design ideas to meet the 
assessment criteria 
● giving detailed specific guidance on errors and omissions that limits a student’s 
opportunity to show initiative themselves 
● intervening personally to improve the presentation, manufacture or content of work. 
Learning hours are not specified because the process of producing the design portfolio is 
iterative and undertaken by the student, on their own, at the school/college. The prototype is 
manufactured under immediate guidance (under direct supervision of a teacher) in 
school/college. Where specialist processes or equipment are required beyond the 
school/college capabilities they may be utilised but this must be documented and 
authenticated in the appropriate section of the Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) 
in Design and Technology Candidate Assessment Booklet (CAB). 
Annotation should be used to explain how marks were applied in the context of the additional 
assistance given. 
If teachers give specific guidance that goes beyond general guidance and do not take it into 
account when marking the work, this will be considered as malpractice. If malpractice is 
suspected, the awarding organisation will investigate. If malpractice is found to have taken 
place a penalty will be applied dependent on the circumstances and severity of the 
malpractice. 
For full information regarding malpractice please see the JCQ document Suspected 
Malpractice in Examinations and Assessments. 
Project writing 
Authenticity 
Teachers and centres must be satisfied that the work is the student’s own and should sign 
the Candidate Assessment Booklet. 
Health and safety 
Centres should develop their own mechanisms so that students know the importance of 
ensuring their own safety and that of others. This should include developing risk 
assessments as part of the manufacturing process, for example by using model risk 
assessments or HSE pro forma to assess likely hazards and risk. Students who might be lone 
working should be given additional information and guidance and the centre must have 
suitable policies and procedures for lone working. Practical making activities must be 
supervised at all times at school/college. 
Resources 
Students should have equal access to resources. Students should have access to a range of 
resources, literature and sources of information to enable them to make choices as required 
for their design and make task. Students should have access to the tools and equipment that 
they will require in order to manufacture their final prototype with a high degree of accuracy 
and skill.

Portfolio guidance 
It is recommended that students produce an electronic portfolio equivalent of approximately 
20-30 sides of A3 paper, for their design, make and evaluate project along with any models 
and their prototype. Electronic portfolios must use either Adobe or Power Point and be 
submitted electronically. Students will not be penalised specifically on the basis of the 
amount of work that they produce. However, excessively high or low amounts of work may 
restrict student’s ability to evidence the skills outlined in the marking criteria.  
Photographic evidence 
As proof of the quality of students’ making skills it is important that all stages of the 
manufacturing process are photographed in order to evidence that the product is an 
appropriate working solution to a need or want that is sufficiently developed to be tested and 
evaluated (for example, full sized products, scaled working models or functioning systems). 
Photographic evidence should also demonstrate that the final prototype/product is fit for 
purpose and in addition to being a working solution; addresses the needs/wants of the 
intended user and is successful in meeting the criteria of the specification. Images should 
show fully the details of the prototype/product, which will require photographs being taken 
from a range of angles to show details of all sides and features of a 3D outcome. 
Photographs should be coloured, well lit, and of a high resolution in order to clearly show 
details of the final outcome. Photographs should be submitted as jpegs, with a maximum 
individual file size of 3 MBs. There should be sufficient photographic evidence to support the 
award of marks, however a maximum quantity of 20 photographs per project is suggested. 
Marking, standardisation and moderation 
Once work has been submitted for marking it may not be given back to students. 
Teachers should mark the project using the assessment criteria grids on the following pages. 
Please refer to the ‘General Marking Guidance’ provided in the CAB for further information on 
how to apply these assessment criteria grids accurately.  
Teachers may annotate students’ work but should also include comments on the CAB to 
justify the marks awarded.  
Where marking has been carried out by more than one teacher in a centre, there must be a 
process of internal standardisation carried out to ensure that there is a consistent application 
of the assessment criteria. 
Marks awarded by the centre will be subject to external moderation by Pearson. Moderation 
will ensure consistency with national standards. Pearson will notify centres of the students 
whose work has been selected for moderation. This sample will take cohort size into account. 
The portfolio and CAB for each student in the sample must be sent to Pearson, in May in the 
year of assessment. Please see our UK Information Manual for the submission deadline date. 
A copy is made available to all examinations officers and is available on our website: 
qualifications.pearson.com 
If the moderation indicates that centre assessment does not reflect national standards, an 
adjustment will be made to students’ final marks to compensate. 
For further information please refer to the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) document 
Instructions for conducting non-examination assessments (new GCE and GCSE 
specifications) on the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk. The assessment of this qualification 
must comply with these instructions.

Security and backups 
It is the centre’s responsibility to keep the work that students have submitted for 
assessment secure. 
Secure storage is defined as a securely-locked cabinet or cupboard. As students are 
producing prototypes, secure storage is defined as a classroom studio or workshop that is 
locked or supervised from the end of one session to the start of the next. 
The rules on storage also apply to electronic data. For example, centres should collect 
memory sticks for secure storage between sessions or restrict student access to specific 
areas of the centre’s IT network. 
For materials stored electronically, centres are strongly advised to use firewall protection and 
virus-checking software, and to employ an effective backup strategy, so that an up-to-date 
archive of students’ evidence is maintained. 
Further information 
For up-to-date advice on teacher involvement and administration of non-examination 
assessments, please refer to the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) document Instructions 
for conducting non-examination assessments (new GCE and GCSE specifications) available

3 Administration and general information 
Entries 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our UK Information Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers and is 
available on our website: qualifications.pearson.com 
Discount code and performance tables 
Centres should be aware that students who enter for more than one GCSE, or other Level 2 
qualifications with the same discount code, will have only the grade for their ‘first entry’ 
counted for the purpose of the school and college performance tables (please see  
Appendix 8: Codes). For further information about what constitutes ‘first entry’ and full 
details of how this policy is applied, please refer to the DfE website: 
www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education 
Students should be advised that if they take two GCSEs with the same discount code, 
schools and colleges they wish to progress to are likely to take the view that this 
achievement is equivalent to only one GCSE. The same view may be taken if students take 
two GCSEs or other Level 2 qualifications that have different discount codes but have 
significant overlap of content. Students or their advisers who have any doubts about their 
subject combinations should check with the institution they wish to progress to before 
embarking on their programmes.  
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, 
special consideration and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
● students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
● all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will be available in English. All student work must be in 
English.

Specification – Issue 4 – November 2022 © Pearson Education Limited 2022

Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to: 
● access the assessment 
● show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment. 
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability, without affecting the integrity of the assessment. 
Access arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty 
under the Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment.  
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable adjustments 
where a person with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in undertaking an 
assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps to overcome 
that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular person may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
including: 
● the needs of the student with the disability 
● the effectiveness of the adjustment 
● the cost of the adjustment; and 
● the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation, or affects timeframes or the security or integrity of the assessment. This is 
because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’.  
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a student's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the 
examination/assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material 
effect on a candidate’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate their level of attainment 
in an assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements 
and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
consideration, please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk.

Malpractice 
Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in controlled assessments discovered before the candidate has signed 
the declaration of authentication form does not need to be reported to Pearson. 
Candidate malpractice found in controlled assessments after the declaration of authenticity 
has been signed, and in examinations must be reported to Pearson on a JCQ Form M1 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form should be emailed to 
candidatemalpractice@pearson.com. Please provide as much information and supporting 
documentation as possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies 
with Pearson. 
Failure to report candidate malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice.  
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or undermines the integrity 
of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on a 
JCQ Form M2(a) (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form, 
supporting documentation and as much information as possible should be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com. Note that the final decision 
regarding appropriate sanctions 
lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
General and Vocational Qualifications Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and 
Assessments Policies and Procedures, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice.

Appendix 5: Command word taxonomy 
The following table lists the command words used in the external assessments. 
 
Command word  Definition 
Calculate Work out a numerical problem using mathematical processes or 
formulae using the appropriate processes in their response. 
Requires showing how the answer has been worked out.  
Points-based mark scheme may credit use of correct formulae,  
use of correct steps/stages of calculation (evidenced by showing 
workings), correct outcome. 
Describe Give an account of the main characteristics of something or  
the steps in a process. Statements in the response should be 
developed but do not need to include a justification or reason. 
Discuss Identify the issue/situation/problem/concept/argumen t within the 
question. Explore aspects of the issue/element/situation/ 
problem/concept/argument. Investigate the  issue/situation etc. by 
reasoning or argument. Does not require a conclusion.  
Evaluate Measure the value or success of something and ultimate ly provide 
a substantiated judgement/conclusion. Review information and 
then bring it together to form a conclusion, drawing on evidence  
such as strengths, weaknesses, alternatives and relevant data.  
Explain Providing an answer and a reason or set of reasons qualifying the 
answer, such as reasons why something can be considered to fulfil 
a need, provide a purpose, communicate an intention . The answer 
must contain some element of reasoning/justification; may be 
used to support a given statement.  
Give/State/Name All of these command words are really synonyms. They generally 
all require recall of one or more pieces of  information. 
Identify Usually requires some key information to be selected from a given 
stimulus/resource. 
Use annotated 
sketches to show 
Using graphical depiction with annotation, give an account of a 
‘process’ showing the steps or stages of the process in the correct 
sequence/order, or give an account of ‘something’ showing a 
series of features/points/trends. The number of points/depth of 
answer required will be indicated by the mark allocation.  
 
Please refer to the Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9–1) in Design and Technology 
Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) for the application of these command words.

From Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class Qualifications 
May 2014 
“The reform of the qualifications system in England is a profoundly important change to the 
education system. Teachers need to know that the new qualifications will assist them in 
helping their learners make progress in their lives. 
When these changes were first proposed we were approached by Pearson to join an ‘Expert 
Panel’ that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. 
We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of 
our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, and a number of countries across Europe. 
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification development 
process that has included: 
● benchmarking assessments against UK providers to ensure that they are at the right level of 
demand 
● establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications 
● subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual 
accreditation criteria in advance of submission.  
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented. The 
design has been guided by what is called an ‘Efficacy Framework’, meaning learner outcomes 
have been at the heart of this development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s success 
in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have supported the 
development of qualifications that are outstanding for their coherence, thoroughness and 
attention to detail and can be regarded as representing world-class best practice.

Appendix 7: Transferable skills 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned and 
that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and can be 
built upon and extended through learning.’ [1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework as the most evidence-based and 
robust skills framework. We adapted the framework slightly to include the Program for 
International Student Assessment (PISA) ICT Literacy and Collaborative Problem Solving 
(CPS) Skills. 
The adapted National Research Council’s framework of skills involves: [2]  
Cognitive skills 
● Non-routine problem solving – expert thinking, metacognition, creativity. 
● Systems thinking – decision making and reasoning. 
● Critical thinking – definitions of critical thinking are broad and usually involve general 
cognitive skills such as analysing, synthesising and reasoning skills. 
● ICT literacy – access, manage, integrate, evaluate, construct and communicate.[3] 
Interpersonal skills 
● Communication – active listening, oral communication, written communication, assertive 
communication and non-verbal communication. 
● Relationship-building skills – teamwork, trust, intercultural sensitivity, service 
orientation, self-presentation, social influence, conflict resolution and negotiation. 
● Collaborative problem solving – establishing and maintaining shared understanding, 
taking appropriate action, establishing and maintaining team organisation. 
Intrapersonal skills 
● Adaptability – ability and willingness to cope with the uncertain, handling work stress, 
adapting to different personalities, communication styles and cultures, and physical 
adaptability to various indoor and outdoor work environments. 
● Self-management and self-development – ability to work remotely in virtual teams, 
work autonomously, be self-motivating and self-monitoring, willing and able to acquire 
new information and skills related to work. 
Transferable skills enable young people to face the demands of further and higher education, 
as well as the demands of the workplace, and are important in the teaching and learning of 
this qualification. We will provide teaching and learning materials, developed with 
stakeholders, to support our qualifications.
