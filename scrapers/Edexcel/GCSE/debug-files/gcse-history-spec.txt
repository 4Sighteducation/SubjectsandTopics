1 Introduction 
Why choose Edexcel GCSE History? 
We’ve listened to feedback from all parts of the history subject community, including a large 
number of teachers. We’ve used this opportunity of curriculum change to redesign a 
qualification that will engage students with a broad and diverse study of the history of Britain 
and the wider world and give them skills that will support progression to further study of 
history and a wide range of other subjects.  
A unified approach – we’re offering a single GCSE History specification that gives you the 
freedom to select from the most popular topics in current Modern World and Schools History 
Project specifications, as well as a number of exciting new topics, including some that are 
brand new to GCSE.  
Clear and coherent structure – our qualification has a straightforward structure with four 
elements, assessed through three externally examined papers. There are no prohibited 
combinations, giving you flexibility to design a coherent course that is appropriate for your 
students.  
Historic environment sites nested within thematic studies – we have chosen a specific 
site linked to each of our well-established British thematic studies that will be engaging for 
students to study.  
Period studies that provide an unfolding narrative – all of the topics we have selected 
tell a story about a period that shaped the world we live in today. We’ve retained two 
popular topics from current specifications (the Cold War and American West) as well as 
introducing several new, engaging period studies.  
Modern non-British depth studies – all of our non-British depth studies are from the 
modern era, allowing the popular topics of Germany, Russia and the USA to be retained, 
while also including a new China topic. There is a focus on interpretations of history in these 
depth studies.  
Medieval and early modern British depth studies – to meet the criteria requirement for 
depth studies to come from two eras, all our British depth studies are pre-modern, with two 
medieval and two early modern topics to choose from.  
Clear and straightforward question papers – we have focused on ensuring that our 
question papers are clear and accessible for students and that mark schemes are 
straightforward in making the requirements clear.  
Builds on Key Stage 3 – we have designed the GCSE to extend students’ knowledge by 
studying new areas of content and by revisiting and deepening their knowledge of content 
studied previously. 
Supports progression to A Level – we planned our GCSE and A Level specifications 
together. This ensures sensible progression of content from GCSE to A Level and similar 
approaches to assessment, so that students will have a coherent and diverse experience of 
history if they take both an Edexcel GCSE and A Level in History.

2 Subject content 
Qualification aims and objectives 
The aims and objectives of this qualification are to enable students to: 
● develop and extend their knowledge and understanding of specified key events, periods 
and societies in local, British, and wider world history; and of the wide diversity of human 
experience 
● engage in historical enquiry to develop as independent learners and as critical and 
reflective thinkers 
● develop the ability to ask relevant questions about the past, to investigate issues critically 
and to make valid historical claims by using a range of sources in their historical context 
● develop an awareness of why people, events and developments have been accorded 
historical significance and how and why different interpretations have been constructed 
about them 
● organise and communicate their historical knowledge and understanding in different ways 
and reach substantiated conclusions. 
Summary of Department for Education content requirements 
This GCSE complies with the requirements specified by the Department for Education (DfE) 
in its document History GCSE subject content (published April 2014). This requires students 
to study, as a minimum: 
● two depth studies, each covering a substantial and short time span: 
o one must be a British depth study from the medieval (500–1500), early modern  
(1450–1700) or modern (1750–present) eras 
o the other must be a European or wider-world depth study from an era different to 
the British depth study 
● a period study of at least 50 years from any of the eras 
● the historic environment through the study of a particular site in its historical context  
● a thematic study involving the study of people, events and developments drawn from all 
three eras defined above.  
The DfE also requires that British history must form at least 40% of the assessed content. 
Creating a coherent and substantial course of study 
The DfE’s History GCSE subject content (April 2014) requires that GCSE History 
qualifications ‘must provide a coherent and substantial course of study’.  
Pearson has provided options in this specification that, in combination, will enable centres to 
create courses that are coherent and substantial. It is important that centres are clear about 
how their chosen combinations of options meet this requirement. Further information about 
different approaches to this can be found in Appendix 2.  
How content is expressed 
Centres should refer to Appendix 3, which provides guidance about how to interpret the 
requirements and expectations around what is taught in the topics.  
Entry codes 
The tables in Appendix 1 show the entry codes that must be used for a centre’s chosen options.

Paper 1: Thematic study and historic environment 
Overview 
The relevant pages of this section specify the content that must be taught for the chosen 
option. All of the content for the option is mandatory. 
Each Paper 1 option is divided into two: a thematic study and a linked study of a historic 
environment. This linked structure promotes topic coherence across Paper 1 and aids 
teaching and learning by allowing the issues studied in the historic environment to be seen 
within a broader thematic context. 
Both parts cover British history. 
Thematic studies 
The thematic studies require students to understand change and continuity across a long 
sweep of history, including the most significant characteristics of different ages from the 
medieval to modern periods. They include people, events and developments and reveal wider 
changes in aspects of society over the centuries and allow comparisons to be made between 
different periods of history. 
Each thematic study begins with an introductory section called The process of change. This 
explains the focus and identifies the relevant concepts and factors that need to be 
understood and applied when teaching the content. 
This content is then divided into four further sections, which run sequentially from medieval 
to the present day. The four sections provide a framework for understanding the option, but 
should not be taken in isolation from each other – students should appreciate developments 
across the option as a whole. Each section is divided into three strands, the third of which 
contains case studies that exemplify content outlined in strands 1 and 2 and provide 
opportunities to make detailed comparisons over time.  
Assessment 
Students will be assessed on their knowledge and understanding, with questions focusing on 
similarity and difference, and change and continuity. This may include turning points 
(significance), extent of, and causes or consequences of change. 
Historic environments 
Each historic environment is linked to a thematic study and focuses on that site in its 
historical context. It examines the relationship between a place and historical events and 
developments. Much of the content is linked to the thematic study, but additionally some of 
the content focuses on the place itself. 
Assessment 
The content is assessed through a question on features of the period and also through a 
historical enquiry. For the historical enquiry, students will need to develop the skills 
necessary to analyse, evaluate and use contemporary sources to make substantiated 
judgements, in the context of the historical events studied. To aid teaching, the content is 
divided into two sections: the first covers the site in its historical context; the second covers 
knowledge, selection and use of sources relevant to this historic environment for enquiries.

Paper 2: Period study and British depth study 
Overview 
The relevant pages of this section specify the content that must be taught for the chosen 
option. All of the content for the option is mandatory. 
Students are required to study one British depth study and one period study. The two parts 
are independent and so any depth study can be combined with any period study. 
British depth studies (pages 22–29) 
The depth studies focus on a substantial and coherent short time span and require students 
to understand the complexity of a society or historical situation and the interplay of different 
aspects within it. Depending on the depth study chosen, these may include social, economic, 
political, religious and military aspects. 
The content is divided into three key topics. These provide a framework for teaching and 
understanding the option, but should not be taken in isolation from each other. For each 
depth study, there is some chronological overlap between key topics – this structure helps 
highlight the complexity and interplay of different aspects within society.  
Assessment 
Students will be assessed on their knowledge and understanding. Questions will target key 
features and causation, and may also target other second order concepts (change, 
continuity, consequence, similarity, difference, significance). 
Period studies (pages 30–39) 
The period studies focus on a substantial and coherent medium time span of at least 
50 years and require students to understand the unfolding narrative of substantial 
developments and issues associated with the period. 
The content is divided into three key topics, which provide a framework for teaching and 
understanding the option. These run in chronological sequence, but should not be taken in 
isolation from each other – students should appreciate the narrative connections that run 
across the key topics. 
Assessment 
Students will be assessed on their knowledge and understanding. Questions will target: 
consequence; significance (of specified events in relation to situations and unfolding 
developments); and analytical narrative (requiring students not only to describe what 
happened, but also to analyse events to find connections that explain the way in which 
events unfolded).

Paper 3: Modern depth study 
Overview 
The relevant pages of this section specify the content that must be taught for the chosen 
option.  
Students are required to study one modern depth study. All of the content for the option is 
mandatory. 
The depth studies focus on a substantial and coherent short time span and require students 
to understand the complexity of a society or historical situation and the interplay of different 
aspects within it. Depending on the depth study chosen, these may include social, economic, 
political, cultural and military aspects. 
The main content is divided into four key topics. These provide a framework for teaching and 
understanding the option, but should not be taken in isolation from each other. For each 
depth study, there is some chronological overlap between key topics – this structure helps 
highlight the complexity and interplay of different aspects within society.  
Assessment 
Students will be assessed on all four Assessment Objectives. All questions may relate to any 
content specified in the four key topics. 
Questions focusing solely on knowledge and understanding will target causation.  
Other questions will target the ability to analyse and evaluate contemporary sources and 
later interpretations. Students should be aware that interpretations are based on evidence 
from their period of study. They should be aware of a range of evidence that can be used to 
reach conclusions. They should study examples of such evidence and consider ways in which 
it could give rise to and support different interpretations. Students should understand a 
range of reasons why interpretations may differ. They should be aware that differences 
based on conclusions drawn from evidence are legitimate and can be explained. They should 
be able to evaluate given interpretations using their own knowledge of the period.

All GCSEs must provide opportunities for students to write responses which are of sufficient 
length to allow students to demonstrate the ability to construct and develop a sustained line 
of reasoning which is coherent, relevant, substantiated and logically structured. 
In this GCSE, these abilities are rewarded in the mark schemes of questions which target 
AO2 and which carry 8 or more marks (the precise mix of these abilities rewarded will vary 
depending on the nature and length of the answer expected). 
Stimulus points 
Many of the questions that reward extended writing provide stimulus points, which students 
may (but are not required to) use in their answer. Students must, however, use additional 
points of their own; failure to do so will be penalised in the mark schemes. 
Stimulus points may be taken directly from words that appear in the specified topic content; 
other stimulus points may not be directly specified where these are central to, and indicated 
by, the specified topic content.

4 Administration and general information 
Entries 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our UK Information Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers and is 
available on our website: qualifications.pearson.com 
Forbidden combinations and discount code 
There are no forbidden combinations of options within this GCSE. 
Centres should be aware that students who enter for more than one GCSE, or other Level 2 
qualifications with the same discount code, will have only the grade for their 'first entry' 
counted for the purpose of the School and College Performance Tables (please see 
Appendix 1: Codes). For further information about what constitutes 'first entry' and full 
details of how this policy is applied, please refer to the DfE website: 
www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education 
Students should be advised that, if they take two GCSEs with the same discount code, 
schools and colleges to which they wish to progress are very likely to take the view that they 
have achieved only GCSE. The same view may be taken if students take two GCSE or other 
Level 2 qualifications that have different discount codes but which have significant overlap of 
content. Students or their advisers who have any doubts about their subject combinations 
should check with the institution they wish to progress to before embarking on their 
programmes. 
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, 
special consideration and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
● students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
● all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will be available in English. All student work must be in 
English.  
Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to:  
● access the assessment 
● show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment.  
 
Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9-1) in History 
Specification – Issue 6 – June 2024 © Pearson Education Limited 2024 
55 
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability, without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under the 
Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment.  
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable adjustments 
where a person with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in undertaking an 
assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps to overcome 
that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular person may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
which will include: 
● the needs of the student with the disability 
● the effectiveness of the adjustment 
● the cost of the adjustment; and 
● the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation, timeframes or affects the security or integrity of the assessment. This is 
because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a student's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the examination/ 
assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material effect on a 
candidate’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate their level of attainment in  
an assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements 
and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
consideration, please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk.

Malpractice 
Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in examinations must be reported to Pearson using a JCQ M1 Form 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form should be emailed to 
candidatemalpractice@pearson.com. Please provide as much information and supporting 
documentation as possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies 
with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice. 
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the 
integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on a  
JCQ M2(a) Form (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice).  
The form, supporting documentation and as much information as possible should be emailed 
to pqsmalpractice@pearson.com. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions 
lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More-detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
General and Vocational Qualifications Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and 
Assessments Policies and Procedures, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice. 
Awarding and reporting 
This qualification will be graded, awarded and certificated to comply with the requirements of 
Ofqual's General Conditions of Recognition. 
The GCSE qualification will be graded and certificated on a nine-grade scale from 9 to 1 using 
the total subject mark where 9 is the highest grade. Individual papers are not graded.

Appendix 2: Creating a broad and coherent 
course of study 
Options have been selected that will meet the DfE criteria and, at the same time, allow 
conceptual, geographical, period and thematic links to be made between across a course of 
study. 
Each thematic study is linked to a specific historic environment. This linked structure has 
been chosen because it will make for a more coherent qualification than would be the case if 
the historic environment were completely free standing. This linkage allows the issues 
studied in the historic environment to be seen within a broader thematic context. 
Since the thematic studies cover both medieval and early modern British history, this 
provides geographical and period context for the British depth studies. In addition, the fact 
that the historic environments focus in depth on modern British history provides balance to 
the overall coverage of British history. 
The modern depth studies are non-British and link conceptually to the early British depth 
studies: together they allow students to explore the nature of societies, the operation of 
power and the forces for change in power-relationships in Britain and a non-British society. 
Students will study in detail the issues, individuals and events that impacted on each.  
Finally, the period studies have been chosen for their suitability to show unfolding narratives 
of substantial developments which have shaped the world we live in today. Links can be 
made between the period studies and modern depth studies in terms of chronology, place or 
issues covered.  
There are many ways in which the defined content gives teachers opportunities to make the 
course of study coherent. Some examples are given below, showing links that exist between 
different parts of the course. Similar links could equally be made by replacing or moving 
topics in these tables, and also by redesigning it, for example to show links between the 
British depth and modern depth studies, or between the thematic studies and modern depth 
studies.

Appendix 3: Interpreting topic content 
The guidance below helps make clear expectations for what needs to be taught. 
Semi colons are used to break up content to separate ideas that are related, where 
commas might be unclear or confusing, for example (Option 10: Crime and punishment 
through time, c1000–present). 
● The abolition of the death penalty; changes to prisons, including the development of open 
prisons and specialised treatment of young offenders; the development of non-custodial 
alternatives to prison. 
Colons are used to show where content is exclusive and limited. In the following example 
from Option 10 (Key Topic 2, c1500–1700: Crime and punishment in early modern England), 
the only crimes that must be studied in relation to new definitions of crime are vagabondage 
and witchcraft: 
● New definitions of crime in the sixteenth century: vagabondage and witchcraft. 
‘Including’ is used to draw attention to examples that are particularly relevant within the 
framework of broader developments, but without limiting the content to these examples. In 
the same section from Option 10, heresy and treason are singled out (below), as examples 
which must be studied because of their prominence in this period and capacity for illustrating 
change in the nature of crime, but they are not the only relevant examples; others may also 
be used to illustrate continuity with, and change from, the period c1000–1500. 
● Continuity and change in the nature of crimes against the person, property and authority, 
including heresy and treason.

Appendix 4: The context for the 
development of this qualification 
All our qualifications are designed to meet our World Class Qualification Principles[1] and our 
ambition to put the student at the heart of everything we do. 
We have developed and designed this qualification by: 
● reviewing other curricula and qualifications to ensure that it is comparable with those 
taken in high-performing jurisdictions overseas 
● consulting with key stakeholders on content and assessment, including the Royal Historical 
Society, the Historical Association, the Schools History Project, teachers, and higher-
education academics to ensure this qualification is suitable for a UK context 
● reviewing the legacy qualification and building on its positive attributes. 
This qualification has also been developed to meet criteria stipulated by Ofqual in their 
documents GCSE (9 to 1) Subject Level Conditions and Requirements for History, published 
in February 2014. 
 
 
[1] Pearson’s World Class Qualification Principles ensure that our qualifications are: 
● demanding, through internationally benchmarked standards, encouraging deep learning and 
measuring higher-order skills 
● rigorous, through setting and maintaining standards over time, developing reliable and valid 
assessment tasks and processes, and generating confidence in end users of the knowledge, skills 
and competencies of certified students

From Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class Qualifications 
May 2014 
“ The reform of the qualifications system in England is a profoundly important change to the 
education system. Teachers need to know that the new qualifications will assist them in 
helping their learners make progress in their lives. 
When these changes were first proposed we were approached by Pearson to join an ‘Expert 
Panel’ that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. 
We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of 
our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe. 
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification development 
process that has included: 
● Extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-performing 
jurisdictions in the world 
● Benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that they are at 
the right level of demand 
● Establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications 
● Subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual 
accreditation criteria in advance of submission.  
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented. The 
design has been guided by what is called an ‘Efficacy Framework’, meaning learner outcomes 
have been at the heart of this development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s 
success in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have 
supported the development of qualifications that are outstanding for their coherence, 
thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as representing world-class best 
practice.

Appendix 5: Transferable skills 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned and 
that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and can be 
built upon and extended through learning.’ 
[1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework as the most evidence-based and 
robust skills framework. We adapted the framework slightly to include the Program for 
International Student Assessment (PISA) ICT Literacy and Collaborative Problem Solving 
(CPS) Skills. 
The adapted National Research Council’s framework of skills involves: [2]  
Cognitive skills 
● Non-routine problem solving – expert thinking, metacognition, creativity. 
● Systems thinking – decision making and reasoning. 
● Critical thinking – definitions of critical thinking are broad and usually involve general 
cognitive skills such as analysing, synthesising and reasoning skills. 
● ICT literacy – access, manage, integrate, evaluate, construct and communicate. [3]  
Interpersonal skills 
● Communication – active listening, oral communication, written communication, assertive 
communication and non-verbal communication. 
● Relationship-building skills – teamwork, trust, intercultural sensitivity, service 
orientation, self-presentation, social influence, conflict resolution and negotiation. 
● Collaborative problem solving – establishing and maintaining shared understanding, 
taking appropriate action, establishing and maintaining team organisation. 
Intrapersonal skills 
● Adaptability – ability and willingness to cope with the uncertain, handling work stress, 
adapting to different personalities, communication styles and cultures, and physical 
adaptability to various indoor and outdoor work environments. 
● Self-management and self-development – ability to work remotely in virtual teams, 
work autonomously, be self-motivating and self-monitoring, willing and able to acquire 
new information and skills related to work. 
Transferable skills enable young people to face the demands of further and higher education, 
as well as the demands of the workplace, and are important in the teaching and learning of 
this qualification. We will provide teaching and learning materials, developed with 
stakeholders, to support our qualifications.
