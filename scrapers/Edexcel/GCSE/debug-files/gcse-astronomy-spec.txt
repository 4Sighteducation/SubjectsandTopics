1 Introduction 
Why choose the Edexcel GCSE in Astronomy? 
Supporting success in science 
Most people are fascinated by the night sky and are interested in stories about our 
continuing exploration of our Solar System and Universe. This course has been developed to 
build on that interest and to give an introduction to the subject of astronomy. 
The course will enable students to understand our position in the Universe, the movements 
of planets and stars, the cycles in the night and daytime sky, and the way in which we use 
technology to observe and interact with space. Students will follow an incredible story of how 
scientists, from ancient civilisations to the modern day, have used their imagination and 
carefully recorded visual measurement to explore the Universe in which we live. 
As with our GCSE (9–1) Science specifications, our Astronomy specification is straightforward 
to deliver. And we’ve selected a range of observational activities to suit schools that are well 
equipped with telescopes and those that are more modestly resourced. Of course, when it 
comes to our assessments, they are shaped to encourage all students to best show what 
they know and can do. 
Every student is different. But we hope that, across the astronomical content and the 
suggested observational activities, you can build an inclusive course, to allow your students 
to enjoy their first steps in astronomy – and maybe turn those steps into giant leaps…!

determined 
c use SI units and related derived units (e.g. kg, km, l.y., pc, AU) 
d use prefixes and powers of ten for orders of magnitude (e.g. tera, giga, mega, kilo, 
centi, milli, micro and nano)  
e interconvert units 
f use an appropriate number of significant figures in calculation. 
Mathematics 
Maths skills will be assessed in the examinations. Those skills that can be assessed in 
relation to a specification point are referenced in the maths column, next to the specification 
point. Please see Appendix 1: Mathematical skills for full details of each maths skill.  
At the end of most topics in this specification, there are details relating to the ‘Use of 
mathematics’ which give the astronomy-specific mathematic skills that are found in each 
topic of content in the document Astronomy GCSE subject content, published by the 
Department for Education (DfE) in March 2016. The reference in brackets after each 
statement refers to the mathematical skills from Appendix 1.  
Please see Appendix 3: Calculators for information on the use of calculators in the 
assessments of this qualification.  
Equations 
Students are not required to recall any equations. The equations that students are expected 
to be able to use are listed in the specification points and in Appendix 2: Formulae and data 
sheet. The formulae and data sheet for each examination are given in the examination 
paper. 
Content 
The specification points all begin with either ‘know’, ‘understand’ or ‘be able to’. These 
command words indicate the depth to which the content must be studied. 
A ‘know’ statement is limited to recalling the facts in the specification content. An 
‘understand’ statement includes all aspects of ‘know’ and additional depth to reach an 
understanding of the content. A ‘be able to’ statement includes all aspects of ‘know’ and 
‘understand’, as well as application of skills for the specification content. 
For example specification statement 1.4 states ‘Be able to use the latitude and longitude  
co-ordinate system’. This means that students can be expected to use the longitude and 
latitude system in questions relating to positions on Earth. They could also be asked to 
explain how longitude and latitude are different to each other and also to recall a definition 
for longitude and latitude.

Observational skills 
Requirements 
Throughout their study of this qualification, students should develop their observational 
skills. Students must undertake at least one unaided and one aided observation, from the 
selection listed in this section. Students will need to use their knowledge and understanding 
of observational techniques and procedures in the written assessments. 
Students need to record the work that they have undertaken for these observations. The 
observation record must include the knowledge, skills and understanding they have derived 
from the observational activities. 
Centres must confirm that each student has completed at least one unaided and one aided 
observation by completing and submitting an Observation Statement (see Appendix 5). This 
must be submitted to Pearson by 15th April in the year that the students will sit their 
examinations. Any failure by centres to provide this Observation Statement will be treated as 
malpractice and/or maladministration. 
It is important to realise that these mandatory observations are the minimum number of 
observations that should be taken during the course. 
Safety is an overriding requirement for all observational work. Centres are responsible for 
ensuring appropriate safety procedures are followed whenever their students complete 
observational activities. 
Pearson may review and amend these observational activities if necessary. Centres will be 
told as soon as possible about any changes to them. 
Skills 
Astronomical observation is an iterative cycle of design, observation, analysis and evaluation. 
Through the evolution of each set of observations, students suggest improvements that form 
the foundation of the design of the next set of observations. 
Astronomical observations require students to: 
1 D esign observations 
2 M ake observations 
3 A nalyse observations 
4 E valuate observations.

1 Design observations 
There are many uncontrollable variables in astronomical observations and reliability is 
improved by iteratively refining the observation programme. All astronomical observations 
require the informed selection of target object, observing site, time and date along with their 
choice of observing equipment. Students should, therefore, be involved in selecting these 
features of their observing programme, as well as refining them. 
Students should: 
a produce a list of feasible target objects, location, date, time and observing instrument, as 
appropriate to their chosen task 
b use astronomical data to select the most appropriate target object, location, date, time or 
observing instrument 
c generate an initial observing programme that will allow them to solve the problem posed 
by the title of their chosen task, including health and safety considerations 
d make refinements or improvements to their observing programme, following the results of 
initial trials. 
2 Make observations 
There are many variables affecting astronomical observations which are outside the control 
of the observer. Students will need to undertake a series of observations in order to generate 
sufficient data to support valid conclusions. This is the observational programme. Students 
should gain experience of undertaking an observational programme in both unaided (‘naked 
eye’) and aided situations, as follows: 
a conduct unaided observations, using techniques such as averted vision, dark adaptation 
b conduct aided observations, using equipment such as binoculars, telescopes and cameras 
c ensure that all observations are accompanied by the necessary observational details, 
including: 
i. date 
ii. time 
iii. location 
iv. seeing conditions 
v. optical instruments used 
d ensure that sufficient observations are taken to produce accurate data for the specific 
task. 
3 Analyse observations 
Students will need to analyse their observations to produce reliable and valid conclusions for 
the specific observation. This will involve a wide range of skills, depending on the nature of 
the original observations, as follows: 
a identify patterns or trends from a series of drawings or photographs 
b present numerical data in the form of graphs or charts 
c perform calculations 
d perform basic digital image processing, including the adjustment of image brightness, 
dynamic range and the use of false colour.

4 Evaluate observations 
Students will need to compare the results of their observations with those obtained by 
professional astronomers or with accepted values. This will enable them to evaluate the 
reliability and accuracy of their resulting conclusions and suggest improvements for further 
observations. This should include the following: 
a compare the results of their observations with professional images or accepted values in 
order to assess their accuracy 
b where possible, calculate a quantitative assessment of their accuracy 
c identify the effects of light pollution on naked-eye observations 
d identify the effects of light pollution, exposure time and filtering on photographic 
observations 
e recognise some of the major artefacts that can affect astronomical images, such as 
scattered light, diffraction spikes, cosmic rays and trails from satellites, aircraft or meteors 
f identify the major causes of error in the conclusions 
g suggest and implement improvements to the observing programme.

Observational tasks 
Each of the following observational tasks sets out a problem, which can be solved by a 
programme of observations. Completion of these tasks will give students an understanding of 
the cycle of astronomical observation and help them to develop the key observational skills. 
Centres must ensure that each student completes at least one unaided and one aided 
observation task from the following list. Students may not select both of their observational 
tasks (unaided and aided) from the same row on the observational task table. For example, 
not A1 and B1.

3 Administration and general information 
Entries 
Details of how to enter students for the examinations for this qualification can be found in 
our UK Information Manual. A copy is made available to all examinations officers and is 
available on our website: qualifications.pearson.com 
Discount code and performance tables 
Centres should be aware that students who enter for more than one GCSE, or other Level 2 
qualifications with the same discount code, will have only the grade for their 'first entry' 
counted for the purpose of the school and college performance tables (please see 
Appendix 8: Codes). For further information about what constitutes 'first entry' and full 
details of how this policy is applied, please refer to the DfE website: 
www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education 
Students should be advised that if they take two GCSEs with the same discount code, the 
schools and colleges to which they wish to progress are likely to take the view that this 
achievement is equivalent to only one GCSE. The same view may be taken if students take 
two GCSEs or other Level 2 qualifications that have different discount codes but which have 
significant overlap of content. Before embarking on their programmes, students or their 
advisers who have any doubts about their subject combinations should check with the 
institution to which they wish to progress.  
Access arrangements, reasonable adjustments, 
special consideration and malpractice 
Equality and fairness are central to our work. Our equality policy requires all students to 
have equal opportunity to access our qualifications and assessments, and our qualifications 
to be awarded in a way that is fair to every student. 
We are committed to making sure that: 
● students with a protected characteristic (as defined by the Equality Act 2010) are not, 
when they are undertaking one of our qualifications, disadvantaged in comparison to 
students who do not share that characteristic 
● all students achieve the recognition they deserve for undertaking a qualification and that 
this achievement can be compared fairly to the achievement of their peers. 
Language of assessment 
Assessment of this qualification will be available in English. All student work must be 
in English.

Specification – Issue 3 – December 2024 © Pearson Education Limited 2024 
49 
Access arrangements 
Access arrangements are agreed before an assessment. They allow students with special 
educational needs, disabilities or temporary injuries to: 
● access the assessment 
● show what they know and can do without changing the demands of the assessment. 
The intention behind an access arrangement is to meet the particular needs of an individual 
student with a disability, without affecting the integrity of the assessment. Access 
arrangements are the principal way in which awarding bodies comply with the duty under the 
Equality Act 2010 to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. 
Access arrangements should always be processed at the start of the course. Students will 
then know what is available and have the access arrangement(s) in place for assessment.  
Reasonable adjustments 
The Equality Act 2010 requires an awarding organisation to make reasonable adjustments 
where a person with a disability would be at a substantial disadvantage in undertaking an 
assessment. The awarding organisation is required to take reasonable steps to overcome 
that disadvantage. 
A reasonable adjustment for a particular person may be unique to that individual and 
therefore might not be in the list of available access arrangements. 
Whether an adjustment will be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors, 
including: 
● the needs of the student with the disability 
● the effectiveness of the adjustment 
● the cost of the adjustment; and 
● the likely impact of the adjustment on the student with the disability and other students. 
An adjustment will not be approved if it involves unreasonable costs to the awarding 
organisation, or affects timeframes or the security or integrity of the assessment. This is 
because the adjustment is not ‘reasonable’. 
Special consideration 
Special consideration is a post-examination adjustment to a student's mark or grade to 
reflect temporary injury, illness or other indisposition at the time of the examination/ 
assessment, which has had, or is reasonably likely to have had, a material effect on a 
candidate’s ability to take an assessment or demonstrate their level of attainment in  
an assessment. 
Further information 
Please see our website for further information about how to apply for access arrangements 
and special consideration. 
For further information about access arrangements, reasonable adjustments and special 
consideration, please refer to the JCQ website: www.jcq.org.uk.

Malpractice 
Candidate malpractice 
Candidate malpractice refers to any act by a candidate that compromises or seeks to 
compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the integrity of the 
qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
Candidate malpractice in examinations must be reported to Pearson using a JCQ Form M1 
(available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to Investigations Team, Pearson, 190 High Holborn, 
London, WC1V 7BH. Please provide as much information and supporting documentation as 
possible. Note that the final decision regarding appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice constitutes staff or centre malpractice. 
Staff/centre malpractice 
Staff and centre malpractice includes both deliberate malpractice and maladministration of 
our qualifications. As with candidate malpractice, staff and centre malpractice is any act that 
compromises or seeks to compromise the process of assessment or which undermines the 
integrity of the qualifications or the validity of results/certificates. 
All cases of suspected staff malpractice and maladministration must be reported 
immediately, before any investigation is undertaken by the centre, to Pearson on a 
JCQ Form M2(a) (available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice). The form, 
supporting documentation and as much information as possible can be emailed to 
pqsmalpractice@pearson.com or posted to Investigations Team, Pearson, 
190 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BH. Note that the final decision regarding 
appropriate sanctions lies with Pearson. 
Failure to report malpractice itself constitutes malpractice. 
More detailed guidance on malpractice can be found in the latest version of the document 
General and Vocational Qualifications Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and 
Assessments Policies and Procedures, available at www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice. 
Awarding and reporting 
This qualification will be graded, awarded and certificated to comply with the requirements of 
Ofqual's General Conditions of Recognition.

Appendix 4: Taxonomy 
The following table lists the command words used in the external assessments. 
 
Command word  Definition 
Add/Label Requires the addition or labelling to a stimulus material given 
in the question, for example labelling a diagram or adding 
units to a table. 
Calculate Obtain a numerical answer, showing relevant working. If the 
answer has a unit, this must be included. This can include 
using an equation to calculate a numerical answer. 
Comment on Requires the synthesis of a number of variables from 
data/information to form a judgement. 
Compare  Find the similarities and differences of two elements given in a 
question. Each point made must relate to both elements, and 
must include a comparative statement of their 
similarity/difference. 
Complete Requires the completion of a table/diagram. 
Describe To give an account of something. Statements in the response 
need to be developed as they are often linked but do not need 
to include a justification or reason. 
Define To set forth the meaning of a word or a phrase. 
Determine The answer must have an element which is quantitative from 
the stimulus provided, or must show how the answer can be 
reached quantitatively. To gain maximum marks there must 
be a quantitative element to the answer. 
Design Plan an observing programme from existing principles/ideas. 
Draw Produce a neat freehand drawing, paying attention to shape 
(and scale where appropriate). 
Estimate Find an approximate value, number, or quantity from a 
diagram/given data or through a calculation. 
Evaluate Review information (e.g. data, methods) then bring it 
together to form a conclusion, drawing on evidence including 
strengths, weaknesses, alternative actions, relevant data or 
information. Come to a supported judgement of a subject’s 
qualities and relation to its context. 
Explain An explanation requires a justification/exemplification of a 
point. The answer must contain some element of 
reasoning/justification, this can include mathematical 
explanations. 
Give/State/Name All of these command words are really synonyms. They 
generally all require recall of one or more pieces of 
information. 
Give a reason/reasons When a statement has been made and the requirement is 
only to give the reasons why.

Command word  Definition 
Identify Usually requires some key information to be selected from a 
given stimulus/resource. 
Justify Give evidence to support (either the statement given in the 
question or an earlier answer). 
Plot Produce a graph by marking points accurately on a grid from 
data that is provided and then drawing a line of best fit 
through these points. A suitable scale and appropriately 
labelled axes must be included if these are not provided in the 
question. 
Predict Give an expected result. 
Show that Verify the statement given in the question by showing each 
step of the working for a calculation. 
Sketch For a graph this would need a line and labelled axis with 
important features indicated, the axis are not scaled. 
State what is meant by When the meaning of a term is expected but there are 
different ways of how these can be described. 
Which of the following Select one of the four answer choices given in a 
multiple-choice question.  
 
Verbs preceding a command word 
Analyse data to explain Examine the data in detail to provide an explanation.  
Analyse data to comment Examine the data in detail to form a judgement. 
Analyse data to 
determine 
Examine the data in detail to come to a conclusion. 
Suggest a … Suggest an explanation or suggest a description.

Appendix 6: The context for the 
development of this qualification 
All our qualifications are designed to meet our World Class Qualification Principles[1] and our 
ambition to put the student at the heart of everything we do. 
We have developed and designed this qualification by: 
● reviewing other curricula and qualifications to ensure that it is comparable with those 
taken in high-performing jurisdictions overseas 
● consulting with key stakeholders on content and assessment, including learned bodies, 
subject associations, higher-education academics, teachers and employers to ensure this 
qualification is suitable for a UK context 
● reviewing the legacy qualification and building on its positive attributes. 
This qualification has also been developed to meet criteria stipulated by Ofqual in their 
documents GCSE (9 to 1) Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements and GCSE Subject 
Level Conditions and Requirements for Astronomy, published in March 2016.  
 
 
[1] Pearson’s World Class Qualification Principles ensure that our qualifications are: 
● demanding, through internationally benchmarked standards, encouraging deep learning and 
measuring higher-order skills 
● rigorous, through setting and maintaining standards over time, developing reliable and valid 
assessment tasks and processes, and generating confidence in end users of the knowledge, skills 
and competencies of certified students 
● inclusive, through conceptualising learning as continuous, recognising that students develop at 
different rates and have different learning needs, and focusing on progression 
● empowering, through promoting the development of transferable skills, see Appendix 7.

From Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class Qualifications 
 
“ The reform of the qualifications system in England is a profoundly important change to the 
education system. Teachers need to know that the new qualifications will assist them in 
helping their learners make progress in their lives. 
When these changes were first proposed we were approached by Pearson to join an ‘Expert 
Panel’ that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. 
We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or because of 
our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the world as diverse as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries across Europe. 
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification development 
process that has included: 
● establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-specific 
expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications 
● subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual 
accreditation criteria in advance of submission.  
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future oriented. The 
design has been guided by what is called an ‘Efficacy Framework’, meaning learner outcomes 
have been at the heart of this development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a learner’s 
success in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident that we have 
supported the development of qualifications that are outstanding for their coherence, 
thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as representing world-class best 
practice.

Appendix 7: Transferable skills 
The need for transferable skills 
In recent years, higher education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the 
need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with 
confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines skills, or 
competencies, as ‘the bundle of knowledge, attributes and capacities that can be learned and 
that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and can be 
built upon and extended through learning.’ 
[1] 
To support the design of our qualifications, the Pearson Research Team selected and 
evaluated seven global 21st-century skills frameworks. Following on from this process, we 
identified the National Research Council’s (NRC) framework as the most evidence-based and 
robust skills framework. We adapted the framework slightly to include the Program for 
International Student Assessment (PISA) ICT Literacy and Collaborative Problem Solving 
(CPS) Skills. 
The adapted National Research Council’s framework of skills involves:[2]  
Cognitive skills 
● Non-routine problem solving – expert thinking, metacognition, creativity. 
● Systems thinking – decision making and reasoning. 
● Critical thinking – definitions of critical thinking are broad and usually involve general 
cognitive skills such as analysing, synthesising and reasoning skills. 
● ICT literacy – access, manage, integrate, evaluate, construct and communicate.[3]  
Interpersonal skills 
● Communication – active listening, oral communication, written communication, assertive 
communication and non-verbal communication. 
● Relationship-building skills – teamwork, trust, intercultural sensitivity, service 
orientation, self-presentation, social influence, conflict resolution and negotiation. 
● Collaborative problem solving – establishing and maintaining shared understanding, 
taking appropriate action, establishing and maintaining team organisation. 
Intrapersonal skills 
● Adaptability – ability and willingness to cope with the uncertain, handling work stress, 
adapting to different personalities, communication styles and cultures, and physical 
adaptability to various indoor and outdoor work environments. 
● Self-management and self-development – ability to work remotely in virtual teams, 
work autonomously, be self-motivating and self-monitoring, willing and able to acquire 
new information and skills related to work. 
Transferable skills enable young people to face the demands of further and higher education, 
as well as the demands of the workplace, and are important in the teaching and learning of 
this qualification. We will provide teaching and learning materials, developed with 
stakeholders, to support our qualifications.
