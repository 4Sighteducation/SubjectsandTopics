           3.8.1.1 Use the following units: kilogram (kg), metre (m), metre/second (m/s), metre/second2 (m/s2), newton (N), second (s), newton/kilogram (N/kg).
       3.8.2 Motion in the universe
           3.8.2.1 Know that the universe is a large collection of billions of galaxies.
           3.8.2.2 Understand why gravitational field strength, g, varies and know that it is different on other planets and the Moon from that on the Earth.
           3.8.2.3 Explain that gravitational force causes moons to orbit planets, causes the planets to orbit the Sun, causes artificial satellites to orbit the Earth, and causes comets to orbit the Sun.
           3.8.2.4 Describe the differences in the orbits of comets, moons, and planets.
           3.8.2.5 Use the relationship between orbital speed, orbital radius, and time period.
       3.8.3 Stellar evolution
           3.8.3.1 Understand how stars can be classified according to their colour.
           3.8.3.2 Know that a star’s colour is related to its temperature.
           3.8.3.3 Describe the evolution of stars of similar mass to the Sun through specific stages.
           3.8.3.4 Describe the evolution of stars with a mass larger than the Sun.
