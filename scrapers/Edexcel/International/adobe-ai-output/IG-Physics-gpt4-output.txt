           2.4.3.2 know that a star’s colour is related to its surface temperature
           2.4.3.3 describe the evolution of stars of similar mass to the Sun through the following stages: nebula, star (main sequence), red giant, white dwarf
           2.4.3.4 describe the evolution of stars with a mass larger than the Sun
           2.4.3.5 understand how the brightness of a star at a standard distance can be represented using absolute magnitude
           2.4.3.6 draw the main components of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (HR diagram)
       2.4.4 Cosmology
           2.4.4.1 describe the past evolution of the universe and the main arguments in favour of the Big Bang theory
           2.4.4.2 describe evidence that supports the Big Bang theory (red-shift and cosmic microwave background - CMB - radiation)
           2.4.4.3 describe that if a wave source is moving relative to an observer, there will be a change in the observed frequency and wavelength
           2.4.4.4 use the equation relating to change in wavelength, reference wavelength, velocity of a galaxy and the speed of light: (change in wavelength / reference wavelength) = (velocity of a galaxy / speed of light)
           2.4.4.5 describe the red-shift in light received from galaxies at different distances away from the Earth
           2.4.4.6 explain why the red-shift of galaxies provides evidence for the expansion of the universe
