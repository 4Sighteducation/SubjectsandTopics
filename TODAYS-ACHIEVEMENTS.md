## What's Next

### Tomorrow: Complete Content Extraction

**Priorities:**
1. ⬜ Fix Accounting content extraction (different HTML structure)
2. ⬜ Upload complete History hierarchical content (levels 1-2)
3. ⬜ Test with 3-5 more subjects
4. ⬜ Refine HTML parsing for different structures

### This Week: Expand Coverage

**AQA Subjects to Complete:**
- Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics
- English Literature, Psychology, Sociology
- Geography, Economics
- **Target:** 15-20 subjects with complete content

### Next Week: Assessment Resources

**Build scraper for:**
- Past papers download
- Mark scheme analysis (AI)
- Examiner report extraction (AI)
- Question bank creation

## Cost Analysis

### Today's Costs:
- **AI calls:** ~15 calls (metadata + components + constraints × 5 extractions)
- **Estimated cost:** ~$0.40
- **Data acquired:** Complete AQA History structure

### Projected Costs (Full AQA):
- **40 subjects × $0.40:** ~$16 for all AQA subjects
- **Assessment resources:** ~$20 for AI analysis
- **Total:** ~$36 for complete AQA coverage

**VERY affordable for the value!**

## Key Decisions Made

1. ✅ **Web scraping > PDF extraction** (more reliable)
2. ✅ **Pattern detection** (handles different subject structures)
3. ✅ **3-level hierarchy** (options → study areas → content points)
4. ✅ **Assessment resources** (past papers essential for quality)
5. ✅ **Same Supabase** (additive tables, won't break app)
