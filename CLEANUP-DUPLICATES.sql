-- CLEANUP DUPLICATE DATA IN SUPABASE
-- Run this before the full batch to start clean

-- 1. Remove duplicate components (keep the newest for each component_code)
WITH ranked_components AS (
  SELECT id, 
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
           PARTITION BY spec_metadata_id, component_code

DELETE FROM spec_components
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM ranked_components WHERE rn > 1
);

-- 2. Remove duplicate constraints (keep the newest for each type+description combo)
WITH ranked_constraints AS (
  SELECT id,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
           PARTITION BY spec_metadata_id, constraint_type, description

-- 3. Remove duplicate Level 0 topics (keep the one WITH component_code if exists, otherwise newest)
WITH ranked_topics AS (
  SELECT id,
         topic_code,
         component_code,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (

  )
  AND topic_level = 0
)
DELETE FROM curriculum_topics
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM ranked_topics WHERE rn > 1
);

-- 4. Verify cleanup
SELECT 'Components after cleanup:' as status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM spec_components
