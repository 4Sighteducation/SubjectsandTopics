# Curriculum Data Structure - Terminology & Plan

## What We Discovered in Supabase

### Successfully Uploaded ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Specification Metadata:** 1 record (AQA History A-Level overview)
- ‚úÖ **Components:** 3 components (but some duplication - need to fix)
- ‚úÖ **Selection Constraints:** 4 rules (geographic diversity, prohibited combos, chronological)
- ‚úÖ **Topic Options:** 30 new records (1A Crusades, 1B Spain, 1C Tudors, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Total Topics for History:** 203 (30 new + 173 existing)

### The Data Looks Good!

Sample topic we uploaded:
```
1B: Spain in the Age of Discovery, 1469-1598
  Period: 1469-1598
  Region: European
  Level: 0
```

**This is perfect!** The choosable era is now in the database with rich metadata.

## The Hierarchy Problem - Different Names for Different Levels

### Current Confusion

The word "topic" means different things at different levels:

**In History:**
- Level 0 = "Option" or "Unit" (1B Spain - CHOOSABLE)
- Level 1 = "Study Area" (Part one: New Monarchy - REQUIRED if you chose 1B)
- Level 2 = "Content Point" (Charles' inheritance - specific flashcard material)

**In Mathematics:**
- Level 0 = "Module" (Pure Mathematics - ALL REQUIRED, no choice)
- Level 1 = "Topic" (Algebra and functions - ALL REQUIRED)
- Level 2 = "Subtopic" (Quadratic functions - ALL REQUIRED)

**In Your Current Database:**
All called "curriculum_topics" with `topic_level` 0, 1, 2

---

## Proposed Solution: Keep Current Schema, Clarify Meaning

### Don't Change Database Column Names! ‚úÖ

**Why:** Your app already works with `curriculum_topics` table. Changing it would break the app.

**Instead:** Use `topic_level` and metadata to distinguish:

| topic_level | Meaning | Is Selectable? | Has Rules? |
|-------------|---------|----------------|------------|
| 0 | Option/Unit/Module | Sometimes (check spec_components) | Check selection_constraints |
| 1 | Study Area/Topic | No (required if parent selected) | No |
| 2 | Content Point/Subtopic | No (all required) | No |

### How to Know if Level 0 is Choosable?

**Check the spec_components table:**
```sql
-- For History Component 1:
selection_type = 'choose_one'  ‚Üí Level 0 topics ARE choosable
count_required = 1
total_available = 11

-- For Mathematics:
selection_type = 'required_all'  ‚Üí Level 0 topics are ALL required
```

---

## What We Should Extract for Each Subject

### Minimum (What We Have Now):
‚úÖ **Level 0 Options** - The choosable units
‚úÖ **Component Structure** - How they're organized
‚úÖ **Selection Rules** - If applicable

### Medium (Recommended Next):
‚ùå **Level 1 Study Areas** - The main topics within each option
- For History: "Part one: New Monarchy 1469-1556"
- For Math: "Algebra and functions"

### Maximum (Future):
‚ùå **Level 2 Content Points** - Specific flashcard material
- For History: "Charles' inheritance and consolidation"
- For Math: "Quadratic functions and graphs"

---

## Recommended Approach: Phased Extraction

### Phase 1: Current (What We've Done) ‚úÖ

**Extract:**
- Specification metadata
- Component structure
- Selection constraints
- **Level 0 only** (the options/modules)

**For History:** 30 choosable options (1A, 1B, etc.)  
**For Math:** ~12 main modules

**Status:** WORKING! ‚úÖ

**Pro:** Fast, cheap (~$0.10 per subject), enough for app beta  
**Con:** Not deeply detailed

---

### Phase 2: Medium Depth (Recommended for Production)

**Add extraction of Level 1 study areas**

For each Level 0 option, extract its main study areas.

**Example for History 1B (Spain):**
```
1B: Spain in the Age of Discovery [Level 0 - already have]
  ‚îú‚îÄ Part one: the establishment of a 'New Monarchy', 1469-1556 [Level 1 - extract this]
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ The forging of a new state, 1469-1516
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ The drive to 'Great Power' status, 1516-1556
  ‚îî‚îÄ Part two: Philip II's Spain, 1556-1598 [Level 1 - extract this]
      ‚îú‚îÄ The 'Golden Age', 1556-1598
      ‚îî‚îÄ Spain: The 'Great Power', 1556-1598
```

**Example for Math:**
```
Pure Mathematics [Level 0]
  ‚îú‚îÄ Algebra and functions [Level 1 - extract this]
  ‚îú‚îÄ Coordinate geometry [Level 1 - extract this]
  ‚îî‚îÄ Calculus [Level 1 - extract this]
```

**Status:** NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

**Cost:** ~$0.30 per subject (3x more AI calls)  
**Benefit:** AI generates much better flashcards

---

### Phase 3: Maximum Depth (Future/Optional)

**Extract Level 2 content points**

For Math, this would be every specific skill.  
For History, this would be every bullet point.

**Status:** May not be necessary - Level 1 might be enough!

---

## Impact on Your App

### Current App Behavior (Won't Break!)

Your app currently:
1. Shows `user_subjects` (e.g., "History")
2. Shows `curriculum_topics` where `topic_level = 1` or all topics
3. User selects topics to study
4. Creates flashcards for selected topics

### With New Data (Enhances App!)

With enhanced data, app COULD:

**Option A: Keep Current Behavior (Safe)**
- Just show level 0 and 1 topics like before
- New metadata/constraints sit in database unused (for now)
- No app changes needed
- **This won't break anything!**

**Option B: Enhanced Selection Flow (Future v1.1)**
- For subjects with rules (History): guide user through selection
- Show "Choose your Component 1 option" ‚Üí 11 choices
- Show "Choose your Component 2 option" ‚Üí 20 choices
- Validate against constraints
- More accurate to real curriculum

## Recommendation for Your 2-Week Beta Timeline

### This Week: Baseline Extraction (Level 0 Only)

**What:**
- Extract Level 0 options for all major subjects
- AQA: History, Math, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, English
- OCR: Same subjects
- Total: ~20-30 subjects

**Why:**
- Fast (already working!)
- Cheap (~$3-5 total)
- Enough data for beta testing
- Won't block app launch

**Timeline:** 2-3 days

### Post-Beta: Deep Extraction (Add Level 1)

**What:**
- Go back and extract Level 1 study areas
- Enhances flashcard generation quality
- Better topic organization in app

**Why:**
- User feedback will tell us which subjects need it most
- More expensive - want to validate first
- Can roll out gradually

**Timeline:** After beta feedback

---

## Concerns Addressed

### "Will changing terminology break the app?"

**NO!** Because we're NOT changing terminology.

**We're using:**
- ‚úÖ Same `curriculum_topics` table
- ‚úÖ Same `topic_name` column
- ‚úÖ Same `topic_level` column (already exists!)
- ‚úÖ Just ADDING new topics at level 0

**Your app will:**
- ‚úÖ Continue to work exactly as before
- ‚úÖ See new level 0 options as additional topics
- ‚úÖ Not break - it's purely additive

### "How to handle consistency across subjects?"

**Answer: Use the metadata!**

For each subject in database:
1. Check `spec_components.selection_type`:
   - `choose_one` ‚Üí User must select from options
   - `required_all` ‚Üí All topics are compulsory
   - `choose_multiple` ‚Üí User selects N from M

2. App adapts behavior based on this flag

**No hardcoding needed!** The data tells the app how to behave.

## Proposed Plan Moving Forward

### TODAY: Verify & Document

**Tasks:**
1. ‚úÖ Verify History data in Supabase (just did!)
2. ‚¨ú Check for duplicates in components table
3. ‚¨ú Document what each level means
4. ‚¨ú Create data dictionary

### TOMORROW: Test with Simple Subject

**Tasks:**
1. ‚¨ú Find AQA Mathematics PDF URL
2. ‚¨ú Run pipeline for Mathematics
3. ‚¨ú Compare: Does Math have selection rules? (probably not)
4. ‚¨ú Verify simpler subjects work too

### THIS WEEK: Expand AQA Coverage

**Tasks:**
1. ‚¨ú Add PDF URLs for 10-15 major AQA subjects
2. ‚¨ú Run pipeline for all subjects
3. ‚¨ú Analyze extraction quality
4. ‚¨ú Refine prompts based on results

### NEXT WEEK: Add Level 1 Extraction (Optional)

**Tasks:**
1. ‚¨ú Enhance extractor to get study areas
2. ‚¨ú Test with History 1B (your example)
3. ‚¨ú Decide if worth the cost/complexity
4. ‚¨ú Roll out if beneficial

---

## Decision Point

**For your 2-week beta launch, you have 3 options:**

### Option A: Ship with Level 0 Only (RECOMMENDED for Beta)
- ‚úÖ Already working
- ‚úÖ Fast to complete
- ‚úÖ Enough for beta testing
- ‚úÖ Won't delay app launch
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Less detailed than possible

### Option B: Add Level 1 Before Beta
- ‚úÖ More detailed data
- ‚úÖ Better AI flashcard generation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Higher cost (~$10-20 for all subjects)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Might delay beta by 3-4 days

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- ‚úÖ Level 0 for most subjects
- ‚úÖ Level 1 for top 5 subjects (History, English, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Balanced cost/benefit
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Inconsistent depth

---

## My Recommendation

**For 2-Week Beta Timeline:**

1. **This Week:** Get Level 0 working for 20-30 subjects (AQA + OCR)
2. **Deploy Beta:** Launch with Level 0 data
3. **Gather Feedback:** See which subjects users struggle with
4. **Post-Beta:** Add Level 1 for subjects that need it based on user feedback

**This approach:**
- ‚úÖ Doesn't delay beta
- ‚úÖ Validates product-market fit first
- ‚úÖ Optimizes investment based on real usage
- ‚úÖ Allows iterative improvement

---

**What do you think? Should we:**
- A) Continue with Level 0 extraction for more subjects?
- B) Add Level 1 extraction now before expanding?
- C) Something else?

Let me know and we'll execute! üöÄ
