# Current Status - Quick Summary

## What's Working ✅

1. **Web scraping**: Successfully finding and scraping topics from subject-content pages
   - Example: Accounting found 37 topics (3.1 through 3.18)
   - Example: Art and Design found 17 topics (3.1 through 3.8)

2. **PDF finding**: Successfully locating PDFs on specification pages
   - Stores URLs in database

3. **Batch processor**: Loops through all 74 subjects correctly

## What's Failing ❌

1. **HTML AI extraction**: Claude not returning valid JSON
   - Error: "Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)"
   - Need to debug AI response

2. **PDF AI extraction**: Has a bug when adding context
   - Error: "'str' object does not support item assignment"
   - Just fixed this!

3. **Upload**: Can't find exam_board_subject to link topics
   - Just added auto-create feature
   - Should work now

## Special Cases Found

**Art and Design**: All 6 A-Level variants (7201-7206) share:
- Same subject content (3.1-3.8)
- Same specification page
- Different codes for different specializations
- Students "choose one title" from the 6

**Solution**: Treat as ONE subject with component saying "choose 1 from 6 titles"

## Next Steps

1. Fix AI JSON parsing (in progress)
2. Test again with 3 subjects
3. If works, run full 74 subjects
4. Check data in Supabase

## Cost Estimate

- **Current approach** (HTML AI + web): ~$0.06 per subject = ~$4.50 total
- **Backup (PDF)**: ~$0.12 per subject if HTML fails
- **Expected total**: $4-7 for all 74 subjects
