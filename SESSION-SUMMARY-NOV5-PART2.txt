KEY LEARNINGS
================================================================================

1. ✅ Manual upload is FASTER for languages than building complex parsers
   - 14 languages completed in ~2 hours
   - Full hierarchies with native text preserved
   - Multilingual Unicode works perfectly

2. ✅ Batch processing is incredibly efficient
   - One paper scraper handles 14 languages
   - One batch runner uploads 9 language topic files
   - Saves massive amounts of time

3. ✅ URL year matters for exam materials pages
   - 2017 vs 2018 makes the difference between 0 and 21 papers
   - Always check the working scraper's URL if available

4. ✅ Generic patterns work well for similar subjects
   - Statistics, Mathematics, Politics, Religious Studies all scraped with one pattern
   - Table-style subjects (X.Y numbering) are very common

5. ⚠️ Some subjects have unique structures
   - History of Art: Themes + Periods model
   - Better to create targeted manual uploads for these

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. **Scrape remaining papers** (5-10 mins each):
   - History of Art
   - Mathematics
   - Politics
   - Religious Studies
   - Statistics
   - Geography
   - Psychology
   - Biology B
   - Physical Education

2. **Complete English topics** (30 mins):
   - English Literature already has scrape_enlgish_lit.py ✅
   - English Language needs topic scraper
   - English Lang & Lit needs topic scraper or manual

3. **Final subjects** (1-2 hours):
   - Biology B (universal scraper should work)
   - Geography (Business scraper should work)
   - Music (manual likely)
   - Music Technology (manual likely)
   - Physical Education (check structure)
   - Psychology (Business scraper should work)
